    <h1>Free GUI Libraries and Source Code</h1> 
    <p> The libraries and source code listed here allow you to design a graphical user interface, or GUI, for your application at a high level, and perhaps non-operating system specific, manner. This eases your coding, and might make your application portable among different platforms, useful if you plan to port it later. Some of the libraries here may also come with a GUI builder, which allow you to design the appearance of your application visually. </p> 
    <p> If you are looking for 3D or 2D engines, image or drawing libraries, animation libraries, and the like, please check out the <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/sourcecode/graphics.shtml" target="_top">Free Graphics Libraries, 3D Engines, 2D Engines, Animation Libraries, Image Drawing Libraries</a> page as well as the <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/sourcecode/games.shtml" target="_top">Free Games Programming Libraries and Source Code</a>, instead. Libraries to handle sound, music, digitized voice, and other audio related functions may be found on the <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/sourcecode/audio.shtml" target="_top">Free Audio, Sound, Music, Digitized Voice Libraries and Source Code</a> page. </p>

      <p> IUP is a cross-platform library for <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml" target="_top">C</a>, <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/miscellaneous.shtml" target="_top">Lua</a> and LED. It provides the facility to create and manipulate a large number of GUI primitives like dialog boxes, labels, buttons, text, multi-line boxes, list boxes, toggles, menus, submenus, file selection dialog boxes, and so on. Platforms supported include Windows (using the Win32 API), Linux (using GTK+), FreeBSD (using GTK+), SunOS (using Motif), IRIX (using Motif) and AIX (using Motif). This library is licensed under the MIT licence. </p>

     </dt> 
     <dd>
      <p> This C++ GUI toolkit, Fast Light Tool Kit, works under Unix-type systems (like Linux), Windows and Mac OS X, making it very useful if you have to write a program that works on a variety of platforms. It supports 3D graphics by using OpenGL. The source code is released under GNU Library Public License (also known as the LGPL) with exceptions that allow static linking. There is also an interface builder that generates a human-readable, editable C++ code for you. If you write C++ GUI programs for a number of platforms, and want a portable high level library that takes care of the lower level details of each platform for you, you might want to check this out. </p>

     </dt> 
     <dd>
      <p> If you need a lightweight cross-platform GUI for real-time embedded devices and an embedded graphics middleware, you may want to check out MiniGUI. It runs on Linux/uClinux, eCos, VxWorks, pSOS, ThreadX, Nucleus, uC/OS-II, Win32. Hardware platforms tested with it include Intel x86, ARM (ARM7, ARM9, StrongARM, xScale), PowerPC, MIPS, and M68K (DragonBall, ColdFire). You can run it with support for threads, processes or compile it to run standalone. It has support for built-in resources like bitmaps, icons, fonts. It has a multi-window and messaging mechanism, commonly used controls like labels, buttons, multi-line edit boxes, list boxes, combo boxes, progress bars, property sheets, toolbars, track bar, tree view, list view, month calendar, grid view, animation, etc, as well as support for dialog boxes and message boxes. You can also use menus, accelarator keys, the caret, timers, Windows resource files, popular image file formats (GIF, JPEG, PNG, Windows BMP, etc), multiple character sets, fonts, etc. The graphics API allows you to do raster operations such as create complex regions, draw and fill ellipses, arcs, polygons, etc. There is also special support for embedded systems such as common I/O operations, byte-order functions, touch screen calibration, etc. The library is released under the GPL. Be sure to select the GPL open source package when you download. </p>

      <p> SmartWin is a C++ abstraction of the Windows API. It is designed to by type safe and be as thin a layer over the Windows API as possible. It currently requires you to either have the <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml" target="_top">free Microsoft Visual C++ compiler</a> (scroll down that page for more information) or the commercial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000089GKV/christopherheng">Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 7.1</a>, since the library is designed specifically for that compiler. </p>

      <p> The Nano-X Window System (formerly MicroWindows) is an Open Source project that allows you to add a graphical windowing environment to your applications that are designed for smaller devices and platforms. It does not require any operating system or graphics system support and writes directly to the display hardware. Very handy if you're developing for the portable handheld and pocket PCs (Palm, etc). They support the Win32 API as well as the Nano-X API, so you should probably be able to port your Windows programs more easily. If you are a PDA developer, you might want to check this out. </p>
