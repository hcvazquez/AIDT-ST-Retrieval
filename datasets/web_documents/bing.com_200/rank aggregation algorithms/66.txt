This program is explained in Section 18.3 of Austin/Chancogne. <p> Java application programs and java applet programs are both compiled into executable bytecodes. But, then, an applet bytecode can be downloaded over the network and run locally on any computer that has a java virtual machine (JVM). To facilitate this process, most modern web browsers contain a JVM. You can also execute an applet with the appletviewer program, i.e., </p><pre>

In order for this process to be clearly defined and reliable, the participating logical operations must obey a set of consistent properties. <p> In logic we use variables to represent propositions (or premises). Java allows for the representation of these propositions as boolean variables; they can take only one of two values -- true (T) or false (F). For example, the statement </p><pre>
    boolean p = (3 &gt;= 2);
</pre> <p> sets up a boolean variable p whose value evaluates to true (T). </p><p> Any logical statement which contains a finite number of logical variables (which of course covers any problem we have to deal with) can be analyzed using a table which lists all possible values of the variables: a "truth table". Since each variable can take only two values, a statement with "n" variables requires a table with 2n rows. </p><p> </p>

When the method is invoked it is passed zero or more values known as arguments. The method will make a computation and then return either nothing, or a single value. Thus, the signature of a method is defined by three parts: 
       <ul> 
        <li> It's name, </li>
        <li> The number, order, type and name of the parameters used by the method, and </li>

This is the third basic principle of object oriented programming. </p><p> This program demonstrates "polymorphism of methods" in Java. The program contains three versions of a method called doSomething(). However, each implementation is unique in its argument specfications.

String objects are immutable, meaning that once a String object has been created, there is no way to modify the string of text it represents. Thus, each method that operates on a string typically returns a new String object that holds the modified string. <p> This program demonstrates the use of "character strings," arrays of character strings, and conversion of strings to numerical values of type integer, float and double. </p><p> A few examples of these methods and their usage can be found in Section 18.9.4 of Austin/Chancogne. <br> </p>

Interfaces provide a formal contract between the class and the outside world which, in turn, will be enforced at build time by the compiler. If your class claims to implement an interface, all of the methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile. As we will soon see in the example below, interfaces also allow collections of objects to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. <p> Here we present code for a simple interface that represents farm workers, that is, the farmer and the dog and horse that help the farmer. </p><p> </p>

The key benefit in using interfaces is that they allow collections of objects to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation.

      <td> <b> Modeling of a Simple Transportation Network. </b> Networks are a fundamental aspect of Civil Engineering Systems. For example, transportation engineers are concerned with the design and operation of rail, road, shipping, and air traffic networks. Hydrology engineers work with networks of waterways. Structural engineers work with networks of load bearing members (usually beams and columns). <p> The following figure is a simplified model of the Washington DC metro system (most of the stations have been omitted): </p><p> </p>

       </center> <p> Passengers need to be familiar with the routes, schedule, and cost of using the metro. Typical questions include: </p>
       <ul> 
        <li> When will the metro open? When will it close? </li>
        <li> How do I get from station A to station B? </li>
        <li> Will I have to change trains? Where? </li>
        <li> How long will it take to get there? And how must will it cost? </li>
        <li> I'm going to the Smithsonian -- what station should I get off? </li>
        <li> I'm at station A. When is the last train to station B? </li>
       </ul> <p> The Smithsonian question is particularly interesting because: (1) it requires that a transportation model be linked to a geographic information systems (GIS) model, and (2) there really isn't a unique answer. </p><p> In its most rudimentary form, the Metro System can be modeled as a graph structure. Nodes in the graph correspond to train stations; the edges correspond to the tracks connecting stations. Graph theory is useful because it provides algorithms to answer questions about routes connecting stations A and B. </p><p> The adjacent code is a first-cut implementation at modeling this problem domain. </p><p> <b> Question </b> <br> How would you extend the basic node-edge graph structure to make the model more realistic. <br> </p>

       </center> <p> As indicated in the adjacent figure, this problem is complicated by the multitude of physical/.geographic, environmental, economic and political factors that can influence the final cost and efficiency of the system. Suppose, for example, that we want to build a road from city A to city B, but that a mountain range spans the most direct route. Is it better to build a road around the mountains, or pay more money upfront to build a tunnel through the mountains and provide a shorter route? </p><p> The standard approach to problems of this type is to deal with each concern separately, and then combine the results. For example, the physical constraints might look like: </p><p> </p>
