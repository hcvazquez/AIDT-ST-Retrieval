    <h1>Free Graphics Libraries, 2D &amp; 3D Engines, Image Drawing</h1> 
    <p> If you need to manage graphics, images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF images) or pictures of any kind, or handle animation in your programs, including writing games, drawing 3D or 2D pictures, you might like to consider the graphics libraries, 3D engines, 2D engines, image manipulation source code (etc) listed here. Some of these are actually production code, used in commercial products. </p> 
    <p> If you are looking for <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/sourcecode/games.shtml" target="_top">game programming libraries and source code</a>, you should also check out our <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/sourcecode/games.shtml" target="_top">Free Game Programming Libraries and Source Code</a> page. The decision to list a particular library or source code package on one or the other page is sometimes arbitrary, so you really should check both pages whether you want graphics libraries or games programming libraries. In addition, if you are looking for a graphical user interface for (GUI) for your program, try the <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/sourcecode/gui.shtml" target="_top">Free GUI Libraries and Source Code</a> page as well. Possibly also relevant are the <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/3d-graphics-software.shtml" target="_top">Free 3D Content Creation Software</a> and <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/imagephotoediting.shtml" target="_top">Free Image Editing and Drawing Tools</a> pages, where you can find software to draw your game objects, backgrounds, textures and create animations, etc. </p> 
    <p> If you are looking for more information on game programming, you might want to check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?mode=books&amp;keyword=game+programming&amp;tag=christopherheng" rel="nofollow">list of books on Game Programming on Amazon.com</a>. </p>

SciTech, makers of the well-known Display Doctor, has released its Scitech MGL library under an open source public license. This full-blown graphics library has loads of features to allow you to write 2D/3D graphics programs (such as games, etc). It has a 3D API that can scale from software-only to full 3D hardware geometry acceleration. You use the OpenGL API to write your program, for the Windows and/or MSDOS environment, thus allowing you to maintain one set of sources for programs on these platforms. The library comes with complete source code, and a host of useful supplemental libraries (also with source code). There are too many features to list here. Check out the website yourself.
