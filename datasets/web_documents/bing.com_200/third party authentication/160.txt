       <br>I have a client running Small Business Server 2000 and they have run into a

       <p>When the application installs, data goes out on a secure web site and <br> information comes in from a static site with a defined IP address. &nbsp;Can I <br> create a rule in ISA that will pass all traffic from 204.104.xxx.xxx to <br> workstation 192.168.16.19 ? <br> </p>
       <p>It was acknowledged today by the software vendor that a problem with the <br> software (Entrust) exists with ISA Server and a patch is being made. &nbsp;The <br> problem, I was told, involves basic authentication and the passing of <br> credentials. &nbsp;It was suggested that I make a DMZ zone for this users <br> computer. <br> </p>
       <p>That's about all the information I have other than all the incoming traffic <br> will always be from 204.104.xxx.xxx. &nbsp;I could appreciate any help. &nbsp;Thanks. <br></p>

       </div>In case of the application is installed on the server it will be tricky to 
       <br> get this working. You have to create a Packet Allow Filter that allows all 
       <br> traffic for the IP address you mentioned. As I wrote this can be dangerous
