     <p>This chapter explains the basic syntaxes of the Java programming language. I shall assume that you could write some simple Java programs. (Otherwise, read "<a href="J1a_Introduction.html">Introduction To Java Programming for First-time Programmers</a>".)</p> 
     <p>To be a proficient programmer, you need to master two things: (1) the syntax of the programming language, and (2) the <acronym title="Application Program Interface">API</acronym> libraries associated with the language.</p> 
     <p>You may also try the "<a href="J2a_BasicsExercises.html">Exercises on Java Basics</a>".</p> 
     <h3>Basic Syntaxes</h3> 
     <h4>Revision</h4> 
     <p>The steps in writing a Java program is illustrated as follows:</p> 
     <img class="image-center" src="images/JavaBasics_Process.png" alt="JavaBasics_Process.png"> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Step 1:</span> Write the source codes (<code>.java</code>) using a programming text editor (such as Notepad++, Textpad, gEdit) or an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> (such as Eclipse or NetBeans).</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Step 2:</span> Compile the source codes (<code>.java</code>) into Java portable bytecode (<code>.class</code>) using the JDK compiler ("<code>javac</code>").</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Step 3:</span> Run the compiled bytecode (<code>.class</code>) with the input to produce the desired output, using the Java Runtime ("<code>java</code>").</p> 
     <p class="float-clear">Below is a simple Java program that demonstrates the three basic programming constructs: <em>sequential</em>, <em>loop</em>, and <em>conditional</em>. Read "<a href="J1a_Introduction.html">Introduction To Java Programming for First-time Programmers</a>" if you need help in understanding this program.</p>

     <h4>Comments</h4> 
     <p>Comments are used to document and explain your codes and your program logic. Comments are not programming statements. They are ignored by the compiler and have no consequences to the program execution. Nevertheless, comments are VERY IMPORTANT for providing documentation and explanation for others to understand your programs (and also for yourself three days later).</p> 
     <p>There are two kinds of comments in Java:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><em>Multi-Line Comment</em>: begins with a <code>/*</code> and ends with a <code>*/</code>, and can span multiple lines.</li> 
      <li><em>End-of-Line (Single-Line) Comment</em>: begins with <code>//</code> and lasts till the end of the current line.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>I recommend that you use comments <em>liberally</em> to explain and document your codes. During program development, instead of deleting a chunk of statements irrevocably, you could <em>comment-out</em> these statements so that you could get them back later, if needed.</p> 
     <h4>Statements and Blocks</h4> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Statement</span>: A programming <em>statement</em> is the smallest independent unit in a program, just like a sentence in the English language. It performs <em>a piece of programming action</em>. A programming statement must be terminated by a semi-colon (<code>;</code>), just like an English sentence ends with a period. (Why not ends with a period like an English sentence? This is because period crashes with decimal point - it is hard for the dumb computer to differentiate between period and decimal point in the early days of computing!)</p> 
     <p>For examples,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">// Each of the following lines is a programming statement, which ends with a semi-colon (;)</span>
int number1 = 10;
int number2, number3=99;
int product;
product = number1 * number2 * number3;
System.out.println("Hello");
</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Block</span>: A <em>block</em> is a group of statements surrounded by a pair of curly braces <code>{ }</code>. All the statements inside the block is treated as one single unit. Blocks are used as the <em>body</em> in constructs like class, method, if-else and for-loop, which may contain multiple statements but are treated as one unit (one body). There is no need to put a semi-colon after the closing brace to end a compound statement. Empty block (i.e., no statement inside the braces) is permitted. For examples,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">// Each of the followings is a "complex" statement comprising one or more blocks of statements.
// No terminating semi-colon needed after the closing brace to end the "complex" statement.
// Take note that a "complex" statement is usually written over a few lines for readability.</span>
if (mark &gt;= 50) {
   System.out.println("PASS");
   System.out.println("Well Done!");
   System.out.println("Keep it Up!");
}
 
if (number == 88) {
   System.out.println("Got it!"); 
} else { 
   System.out.println("Try Again!"); 
}
 
i = 1;
while (i &lt; 8) {
   System.out.print(i + " ");
   ++i; 
}
 
public static void main(String[] args) {
   ...<em>statements...</em> 
}</pre> 
     <h4>White Spaces and Formatting Source Codes</h4> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">White Spaces</span>: <em>Blank</em>, <em>tab</em> and <em>newline</em> are collectively called <em>white spaces</em>. Java, like most of the computing languages, ignores <em>extra</em> white spaces. That is, multiple contiguous white spaces are treated as a <em>single</em> white space.</p> 
     <p>You need to use a white space to separate two keywords or tokens to avoid ambiguity, e.g.,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int sum=0;       <span class="color-comment">// Cannot write intsum=0. Need at least one white space between "int" and "sum"</span>
double average;  <span class="color-comment">// Again, need at least a white space between "double" and "average"</span></pre> 
     <p>Additional white spaces and extra lines are, however, ignored, e.g.,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">// same as above</span>
int  sum 
 =  0      ;

   double  average  ;</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Formatting Source Codes</span>: As mentioned, extra white spaces are ignored and have no computational significance. However, proper indentation (with tabs and blanks) and extra empty lines greatly improves the readability of the program. This is extremely important for others (and yourself three days later) to understand your programs. </p> 
     <p>For example, the following one-line hello-world program works. But can you read and understand the program?</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
public class Hello{public static void main(String[] args){System.out.println("Hello, world!");}}
</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Braces</span>: Java's convention is to place the beginning brace at the end of the line, and align the ending brace with the start of the statement.</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Indentation</span>: Indent each <em>level</em> of the body of a block by an extra 3 (or 4) spaces.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">/*
 * Recommended Java programming style
 */</span>
public class <em><strong>ClassName</strong></em> {      <span class="color-comment">// Place the beginning brace at the end of the current line</span>
   public static void main(String[] args) {  <span class="color-comment">// Indent the body by an extra 3 or 4 spaces for each level</span>
   
      <span class="color-comment">// Use empty line liberally to improve readability</span>
      <span class="color-comment">// Sequential statements</span>
      <em>statement</em>;
      <em>statement</em>;
   
      <span class="color-comment">// Conditional statement</span>
      if (<em>test</em>) {
         <em>statements</em>;
      } else {
         <em>statements</em>;
      }
      
      <span class="color-comment">// loop</span>
      <em>init</em>;
      while (<em>test</em>) {
         <em>statements</em>;
         <em>update</em>;
      }
   }
}   <span class="color-comment">// ending brace aligned with the start of the statement</span></pre> 
     <h3>Variables and Types</h3> 
     <h4>Variables</h4> 
     <p>Computer programs manipulate (or process) data. A <em>variable</em> is used to <em>store a piece of data</em> for processing. It is called <em>variable</em> because you can change the value stored.</p> 
     <p>More precisely, a <em>variable</em> is a <em>named</em> storage location, that stores a <em>value</em> of a particular data <em>type</em>. In other words, a <em>variable</em> has a <em>name</em>, a <em>type</em> and stores a <em>value</em>.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>A variable has a <em>name</em> (aka <em>identifier</em>), e.g., <code>radius</code>, <code>area</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>height</code>. The name is needed to uniquely identify each variable, so as to assign a value to the variable (e.g., <code>radius=1.2</code>), as well as to retrieve the value stored (e.g., <code>radius*radius*3.1419265</code>).</li> 
      <li>A variable has a <em>type</em>. Examples of Java <em>type</em> are: 
       <ul> 
        <li><code>int</code>: meant for integers (whole numbers) such as <code>123</code> and <code>-456</code>.</li> 
        <li><code>double</code>: meant for floating-point (real numbers), such as <code>3.1416</code>, <code>-55.66</code>, <code>1.2e3</code>, <code>-4.5E-6</code>, having a optional decimal point and fractional part.</li> 
        <li><code>String</code>: meant for texts such as <code>"Hello"</code>, <code>"Good Morning!"</code>. Strings are enclosed within a pair of double quotes.</li> 
        <li><code>char</code>: meant for a single character, such as <code>'a'</code>, <code>'8'</code>. A char is enclosed by a pair of single quotes.</li> 
       </ul></li> 
      <li>A variable can store a <em>value</em> of that particular data <em>type</em>. It is important to take note that a variable in most programming languages is associated with a type, and can only store value of the particular type. For example, a <code>int</code> variable can store an integer value such as <code>123</code>, but NOT real number such as <code>12.34</code>, nor string such as <code>"Hello"</code>.</li> 
      <li>The concept of <em>type</em> was introduced in the early programming languages to simplify interpretation of data made up of binary numbers (<code>0</code>'s and <code>1</code>'s). The type determines the size and layout of the data, the range of its values, and the set of operations that can be applied.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>The following diagram illustrates three types of variables: <code>int</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>String</code>. An <code>int</code> variable stores an integer (or whole number or fixed-point number); a <code>double</code> variable stores a floating-point number or real number; a <code>String</code> variable stores texts.</p> 
     <img class="image-center" src="images/JavaBasics_Variable.png" alt="variable"> 
     <h4>Identifiers (or Names)</h4> 
     <p>An <em>identifier</em> is needed to <em>name</em> a variable (or any other entity such as a method or a class). Java imposes the following <em>rules on identifiers</em>:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>An identifier is a sequence of characters, of any length, comprising uppercase and lowercase letters <code>(a-z, A-Z)</code>, digits <code>(0-9)</code>, underscore <code>"_"</code>, and dollar sign <code>"$"</code>.</li> 
      <li>White space (blank, tab, newline) and other special characters (such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, commas, etc.) are not allowed. Take note that blank and dash (<code>-</code>) are not allowed, i.e., "<code>max value</code>" and "<code>max-value</code>" are not valid names. (This is because blank creates two tokens and dash crashes with minus sign!)</li> 
      <li>An identifier must begin with a letter <code>(a-z, A-Z)</code> or underscore (<code>_</code>). It cannot begin with a digit <code>(0-9)</code> (because that could confuse with a number). Identifiers begin with dollar sign (<code>$</code>) are reserved for system-generated entities.</li> 
      <li>An identifier cannot be a reserved keyword or a reserved literal (e.g., <code>class</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>).</li> 
      <li>Identifiers are case-sensitive. A <code>rose</code> is NOT a <code>Rose</code>, and is NOT a <code>ROSE</code>.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><span class="line-heading color-error">Caution</span>: Programmers don't use <em>blank</em> character in names. It is either not supported (e.g., in Java and C/C++), or will pose you many more challenges.</p> 
     <h5>Variable Naming Convention</h5> 
     <p>A variable name is a noun, or a noun phrase made up of several words with no spaces between words.&nbsp;The first word is in lowercase, while the remaining words are initial-capitalized. For example, <code>thefontSize</code>, <code>roomNumber</code>, <code>xMax</code>, <code>yMin</code>, <code>xTopLeft</code> and <code>thisIsAVeryLongVariableName</code>. This convention is also known as <em>camel-case</em>.</p> 
     <h5>Recommendations</h5> 
     <ol> 
      <li>It is important to choose a name that is <em>self-descriptive</em> and closely reflects the meaning of the variable, e.g., <code>numberOfStudents</code> or <code>numStudents</code>, but not <code>n</code> or <code>x</code>, to store the number of students. It is okay to use long names!</li> 
      <li>Do not use <em>meaningless</em> names like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>i1</code>, <code>j99</code>.</li> 
      <li>Avoid <em>single-letter</em> names like <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, which is easier to type but often meaningless. Exception are common names like <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code> for coordinates, <code>i</code> for index. Long names are harder to type, but self-document your program. (I suggest you spend sometimes practicing your typing.)</li> 
      <li>Use <em>singular</em> and <em>plural</em> nouns prudently to differentiate between singular and plural variables.&nbsp; For example, you may use the variable <code>row</code> to refer to a single row number and the variable <code>rows</code> to refer to many rows (such as an array of rows - to be discussed later).</li> 
     </ol> 
     <h4>Variable Declaration</h4> 
     <p>To use a variable in your program, you need to first "introduce" it by <em>declaring</em> its <em>name</em> and <em>type</em>, in one of the following syntaxes. The act of declaring a variable allocates a storage (of size capable of holding a value of the type).</p> 
     <table class="table-program"> 
      <tbody>
       <tr> 
        <th>Syntax</th> 
        <th>Example</th> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td> <pre class="color-syntax"><span class="color-comment">// Declare a variable of a specified type</span>
<em>type identifier</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="color-comment">// Declare multiple variables of the same type, separated by commas</span>
<em>type identifier1</em><strong>,</strong> <em>identifier2</em><strong>,</strong> ...<strong>,</strong> <em>identifierN</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="color-comment">// Declare a variable and assign an initial value</span>
<em>type identifier</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>initialValue</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="color-comment">// Declare multiple variables with initial values</span>
<em>type identifier1</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>initValue1</em><strong>,</strong> ...<strong>,</strong> <em>identifierN</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>initValueN</em><strong>;</strong>
</pre> </td> 
        <td> <pre class="color-explanation">&nbsp;
int option;
&nbsp;
double sum, difference, product, quotient;
&nbsp;
int magicNumber = 88;
&nbsp;
String greetingMsg = "Hi!", quitMsg = "Bye!";
</pre> </td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody>
     </table> 
     <p>Take note that:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Java is a "strongly type" language. A variable is declared with a <em>type</em>. Once the <em>type</em> of a variable is declared, it can only store a value belonging to this particular type. For example, an <code>int</code> variable can hold only integer such as <code>123</code>, and NOT floating-point number such as <code>-2.17</code> or text string such as <code>"Hello"</code>.</li> 
      <li>Each variable can only be declared once.</li> 
      <li>You can declare a variable anywhere inside the program, as long as it is declared before used.</li> 
      <li> The type of a variable cannot be changed inside the program, after it is declared.</li> 
      <li>A variable declaration statement begins with a <em>type</em>, and works for only that type. In other words, you cannot declare variables of two different type in a single declaration statement.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h4>Constants (<span class="font-code">final</span> Variables)</h4> 
     <p>Constants are <em>non-modifiable</em> variables, declared with keyword <code>final</code>. Their values cannot be changed during program execution. Also, constants must be initialized during declaration. For examples:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<strong>final</strong> double PI = 3.1415926;  <span class="color-comment">// Need to initialize</span></pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Constant Naming Convention:</span> Use uppercase words, joined with underscore. For example, <code>MIN_VALUE</code>, <code>MAX_SIZE</code>.</p> 
     <h4>Expressions</h4> 
     <p>An <em>expression</em> is a combination of <em>operators</em> (such as addition <code>'+'</code>, subtraction <code>'-'</code>, multiplication <code>'*'</code>, division <code>'/'</code>) and <em>operands</em> (variables or literals), that can be <em>evaluated to yield a single value of a certain type</em>. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment"></span>1 + 2 * 3           <span class="color-comment">// evaluated to int 7</span>
 
int sum, number;
sum + number        <span class="color-comment">// evaluated to an int value</span>
 
double principal, interestRate;
principal * (1 + interestRate)  <span class="color-comment">// Evaluated to a double value</span></pre> 
     <h4>Assignment</h4> 
     <p>An <em>assignment statement</em>:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>assigns a literal value (of the <acronym title="Right-Hand Sdie">RHS</acronym>) to a variable (of the <acronym title="Left-Hand Sdie">LHS</acronym>), e.g., <code>x = 1</code>; or</li> 
      <li>evaluates an expression (of the RHS) and assign the resultant value to a variable (of the LHS), e.g., <code>x = (y + z) / 2</code>.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>The syntax for assignment statement is:</p> 
     <table class="table-program"> 
      <colgroup>
       <col style="width:60%"> 
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>
       <tr> 
        <th>Syntax</th> 
        <th>Example</th> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td> <pre class="color-syntax"><span class="color-comment">// Assign the literal value (of the RHS) to the variable (of the LHS)</span>
<em>variable</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>literalValue</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="color-comment">// Evaluate the expression (RHS) and assign the result to the variable (LHS)</span>
<em>variable</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>expression</em><strong>;</strong></pre> </td> 
        <td> <pre class="color-explanation">&nbsp;
number = 88;
&nbsp;
sum = sum + number;</pre> </td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody>
     </table> 
     <p>The assignment statement should be interpreted this way: The <em>expression</em> on the right-hand-side (RHS) is first evaluated to produce a resultant value (called <em>r-value</em> or right-value). The <em>r-value</em> is then assigned to the variable on the left-hand-side (LHS) or <em>l-value</em>. Take note that you have to first evaluate the RHS, before assigning the resultant value to the LHS. For examples,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
number = 8;           <span class="color-comment">// Assign literal value of 8 to the variable number</span>
number = number + 1;  <span class="color-comment">// Evaluate the expression of number + 1,
                      //  and assign the resultant value back to the variable number</span>
8 = number;           <span class="color-error">// INVALID</span>
number + 1 = sum;     <span class="color-error">// INVALID</span></pre> 
     <p>In Java, the equal symbol <code>'='</code> is known as the <em>assignment operator</em>. The meaning of <code>'='</code> in programming is different from Mathematics. It denotes <em>assignment of the LHS value to the RHS variable</em>, instead of <em>equality of the RHS and LHS</em>. The RHS shall be a literal value or an expression that evaluates to a value; while the LHS must be a variable. </p> 
     <p>Note that <code>x = x + 1</code> is valid (and often used) in programming. It evaluates <code>x + 1</code> and assign the resultant value to the variable <code>x</code>. <code>x = x + 1</code> illegal in Mathematics.</p> 
     <p> While <code>x + y = 1</code> is allowed in Mathematics, it is invalid in programming (because the LHS of an assignment statement must be a variable).</p> 
     <p> Some programming languages use symbol "<code>:=</code>", "<code>-&gt;</code>" or "<code>&lt;-</code>" as the assignment operator to avoid confusion with equality.</p> 
     <h4>Primitive Types</h4> 
     <p>In Java, there are two broad categories of <em>types</em>: <em>primitive types</em> (e.g., <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>) and <em>reference types</em> (e.g., objects and arrays<em>)</em>. We shall describe the primitive types here and the reference types (classes and objects) in the later chapters on "Object-Oriented Programming".</p>

     <h5>Built-in Primitive Types</h5> 
     <p>Primitive type are built-in to the languages. Java has eight <em>primitive types</em>, as listed in the above table:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>There are four integer types: 8-bit <code>byte</code>, 16-bit <code>short</code>, 32-bit <code>int</code> and 64-bit <code>long</code>. They are <em>signed integers</em> in <em>2's complement representation</em>, and can hold an integer value of the various ranges as shown in the table.</li> 
      <li>There are two floating-point types: 32-bit single-precision <code>float</code> and 64-bit double-precision <code>double</code>, represented as specified by IEEE 754 standard. A <code>float</code> can represent a number between <code>±1.40239846×10^-45</code> and <code>±3.40282347×10^38</code>, approximated. A <code>double</code> can represented a number between <code>±4.94065645841246544×10^-324</code> and <code>±1.79769313486231570×10^308</code>, approximated. Take note that not all real numbers can be represented by <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>. This is because there are infinite real numbers even in a small range of say <code>[1.1, 2.2]</code>, but there is a finite number of patterns in a n-bit representation. Most of the floating-point values are approximated to their nearest representation.</li> 
      <li>The type <code>char</code> represents a single character, such as <code>'0'</code>, <code>'A'</code>, <code>'a'</code>. In Java, char is represented using 16-bit Unicode (in UCS-2 format) to support internationalization (<em>i18n</em>). A <code>char</code> can be treated as a <em>16-bit unsigned integer</em> (in the range of <code>[0, 65535]</code>) in arithmetic operations. For example, character <code>'0'</code> is <code>48</code> (decimal) or <code>30H</code> (hexadecimal); character <code>'A'</code> is <code>65</code> (decimal) or <code>41H</code> (hexadecimal); character <code>'a'</code> is <code>97</code> (decimal) or <code>61H</code> (hexadecimal).</li> 
      <li>Java introduces a new <em>binary </em>type called "<code>boolean</code>", which takes a value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example</span>: The following program can be used to print the <em>maximum</em>, <em>minimum</em> and <em>bit-length</em> of the primitive types. The maximum, minimum and bit-size of <code>int</code> are kept in constants <code>INTERER.MIN_VALUE</code>, <code>INTEGER.MAX_VALUE</code>, <code>INTEGER.SIZE</code>.</p>

     <h5>String</h5> 
     <p>Another commonly-used type is <code>String</code>, which represents texts (a sequence of characters) such as <code>"Hello, world"</code>. <code>String</code> is not a primitive type, and will be further elaborated later. In Java, a <code>char</code> is enclosed by single quotes (e.g., <code>'A'</code>, <code>'0'</code>), while a <code>String</code> is enclosed by double quotes (e.g., <code>"Hello"</code>). For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
String message = "Hello, world!"; <span class="color-comment">// strings are enclosed in double-quotes</span>
char gender = 'm';                <span class="color-comment">// char is enclosed in single-quotes</span></pre> 
     <h5>Choice of Data Types for Variables</h5> 
     <p>As a programmer, you need to choose variables and decide on the type of the variables to be used in your programs. Most of the times, the decision is intuitive. For example, use an integer type for counting and whole number; a floating-point type for number with fractional part, <code>String</code> for text message, <code>char</code> for a single character, and <code>boolean</code> for binary outcomes.</p> 
     <h5>Rules of Thumb</h5> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Use <code>int</code> for integer and <code>double</code> for floating point numbers. Use <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>long</code> and <code>float</code> only if you have a good reason to choose that specific precision.</li> 
      <li>Use <code>int</code> for <em>counting</em> and <em>indexing</em>, NOT floating-point type (<code>float</code> or <code>double</code>). This is because integer type are precise and more efficient in operations.</li> 
      <li>Use an integer type if possible. Use a floating-point type only if the number contains a fractional part.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h5>Data Representation</h5> 
     <p>Read "<a href="DataRepresentation.html">Data Representation</a>" if you wish to understand how the numbers and characters are represented inside the computer memory. In brief, It is important to take note that char <code>'1'</code> is different from <code>int</code> <code>1</code>, <code>byte</code> <code>1</code>, <code>short</code> <code>1</code>, <code>float</code> <code>1.0</code>, <code>double</code> <code>1.0</code>, and <code>String</code> <code>"1"</code>. They are represented differently in the computer memory, with different precision and interpretation. For example, <code>byte</code> <code>1</code> is <code>"00000001"</code>, <code>short</code> <code>1</code> is <code>"00000000 00000001"</code>, <code>int</code> <code>1</code> is <code>"00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001"</code>, <code>long</code> <code>1</code> is <code>"00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001"</code>, <code>float</code> <code>1.0</code> is <code>"0 01111111 0000000 00000000 00000000"</code>, <code>double</code> <code>1.0</code> is <code>"0 01111111111 0000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000"</code>, <code>char</code> <code>'1'</code> is <code>"00000000 00110001"</code>, and <code>String</code> <code>"1"</code> is a complex object.</p> 
     <p> There is a subtle difference between <code>int</code> <code>0</code> and <code>double</code> <code>0.0</code>.</p> 
     <p>Furthermore, you MUST know the type of a value before you can interpret a value. For example, this value <code>"00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001"</code> cannot be interpreted unless you know its type (or its representation).</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example (Variable Names and Types):</span> Paul has bought a new notebook of "abc" brand, with a processor speed of 3.2GHz, 4 GB of RAM, 500GB hard disk, with a 15-inch monitor, for $1650.45. He has chosen service plan 'B' among plans 'A', 'B' and 'C', plus on-site servicing. Identify the data types and name the variables.</p>

This includes name, address, phone number, gender, date of birth, height, weight, degree pursued (e.g., B.Sc., B.A.), year of study, average GPA, with/without tuition grant, is/is not a scholar. Each student is assigned a unique 8-digit number as id. Identify the variables. Assign a suitable name to each variable and choose an appropriate type. Write the variable declaration statements.</p> 
     <h4>Literals for Primitive Types and String</h4> 
     <p>A <em>literal</em>, or <em>literal constant</em>, is a <em>specific constant value</em>, such as <code>123</code>, <code>-456</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>-1.2e3</code>, <code>'a'</code>, <code>"Hello"</code>, that is used in the program source. It can be assigned directly to a variable; or used as part of an expression. They are called <em>literals</em> because they literally and explicitly identify their values. We call it <em>literal</em> to distinguish it from a <em>variable</em>.</p> 
     <h5>Integer (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>byte</code>) literals</h5> 
     <p>A whole number, such as <code>123</code> and <code>-456</code>, is treated as an <code>int</code> by default. In Java, the range of 32-bit <code>int</code> literals is <code>-2,147,483,628</code> (<code>-2^31</code>) to <code>2,147,483,627</code> (<code>2^31-1</code>). For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int number = -123;
int sum = 1234567890;     <span class="color-comment">// This value is within the range of int</span>
<span class="color-error">int bigSum = 8234567890;</span>  <span class="color-comment">// ERROR: this value is outside the range of int</span></pre> 
     <p>An <code>int</code> literal may precede with a plus (<code>+</code>) or minus (<code>-</code>) sign, followed by digits. No commas or special symbols (e.g., <code>$</code> or space) is allowed (e.g., <code>1,234</code> and <code>$123</code> are invalid). No preceding <code>0</code> is allowed too (e.g., <code>007</code> is invalid).</p> 
     <p>You can use a prefix <code>'0'</code> (zero) to denote a value in octal, and prefix <code>'0x'</code> (or <code>'0X'</code>) for a value in hexadecimal, e.g.,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int number = 1234;   <span class="color-comment">// Decimal</span>
int number = 01234;  <span class="color-comment">// Octal 1234, Decimal 2322</span>
int number = 0x1abc; <span class="color-comment">// hexadecimal 1ABC, decimal 15274</span></pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">(JDK 1.7)</span> From JDK 7, you can use prefix '<code>0b</code>' or '<code>0B</code>' to specify a value in binary. You are also permitted to use underscore (<code>_</code>) to break the digits into groups to improve the readability. But you must start and end the literal with a digit. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int number1 = 0b01010000101000101101000010100010;
int number2 = 0b0101_0000_1010_0010_1101_0000_1010_0010;  <span class="color-comment">// break the digits with underscore (JDK 1.7)</span>
int number3 = 2_123_456;  <span class="color-comment">// break the digits with underscore (JDK 1.7)</span></pre> 
     <p>A <code>long</code> literal above the <code>int</code> range requires a suffix <code>'L'</code> or <code>'l'</code> (avoid lowercase, which confuses with the number one), e.g., <code>123456789012L</code>, <code>-9876543210l</code>. In Java, the range of 64-bit <code>long</code> literals is <code>-9,223,372,036,854,775,808L</code> (<code>-2^63</code>) to <code>9,223,372,036,854,775,807L</code> (<code>2^63-1</code>). For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
long bigNumber = 1234567890123L;  <span class="color-comment">// Suffix 'L' needed</span>
long sum = 123;                   <span class="color-comment">// int 123 auto-casts to long 123L</span>
</pre> 
     <p>No suffix is needed for <code>byte</code> and <code>short</code> literals. But you can only use integer values in the permitted range. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-error">byte smallNumber = 12345;</span>    <span class="color-comment"> // ERROR: this value is outside the range of byte.</span>
byte smallNumber = 123;       <span class="color-comment">// This is within the range of byte</span>
short midSizeNumber = -12345;</pre> 
     <h5>Floating-point (<code>double</code>, <code>float</code>) literals</h5> 
     <p>A number with a decimal point, such as <code>55.66</code> and <code>-33.44</code>, is treated as a <code>double</code> by default. You can also express them in scientific notation, e.g., <code>1.2e3</code>, <code>-5.5E-6</code>, where <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> denotes the exponent in base of 10. You could precede the fractional part or exponent with a plus (<code>+</code>) or minus (<code>-</code>) sign. Exponent values are restricted to integer. There should be no space or other characters in the number.</p> 
     <p>You can <em>optionally</em> use suffix <code>'d'</code> or <code>'D'</code> to denote <code>double</code> literals.</p> 
     <p>You MUST use a suffix of <code>'f'</code> or <code>'F'</code> for <code>float</code> literals, e.g., <code>-1.2345F</code>. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-error">float average = 55.66;</span>      <span class="color-comment">// Error! RHS is a double. Need suffix 'f' for float.</span>
float average = 55.66f;</pre> 
     <h5>Character (<code>char</code>) Literals and Escape Sequences</h5> 
     <p>A printable <code>char</code> literal is written by enclosing the character with a pair of <em>single quotes</em>, e.g., <code>'z'</code>, <code>'$'</code>, and <code>'9'</code>. In Java, characters are represented using 16-bit Unicode, and can be treated as a 16-bit <em>unsigned integer</em>s in arithmetic operations. In other words, <code>char</code> and 16-bit unsigned integer are interchangeable. You can also assign an integer in the range of <code>[0, 65535]</code> to a <code>char</code> variable.</p> 
     <p>For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
char letter = 'a';                 <span class="color-comment">// Same as 97</span>
char anotherLetter = 98;           <span class="color-comment">// Same as the letter 'b'</span>
System.out.println(letter);        <span class="color-comment">// 'a' printed</span>
System.out.println(anotherLetter); <span class="color-comment">// 'b' printed instead of the number</span>
anotherLetter += 2;                <span class="color-comment">// 100 or 'd'</span>
System.out.println(anotherLetter); <span class="color-comment">// 'd' printed</span></pre> 
     <p>Non-printable and control characters can be represented by a so-called <em>escape sequence</em>, which begins with a back-slash (<code>\</code>) followed by a pattern. The commonly-used escape sequences are:</p>

      <li>To resolve <em>ambiguity</em>, characters back-slash (<code>\</code>), single-quote (<code>'</code>) and double-quote (<code>"</code>) are represented using escape sequences <code>\\</code>, <code>\'</code> and <code>\"</code>, respectively. E.g., 
       <ul> 
        <li>To represent a back-slash <code>char</code>, you need to write <code>'\\'</code>, instead of <code>'\'</code>, as a back-slash begins an escape sequence. Similarly, to include a back-slash in a double-quoted string, you need to write <code>\\</code>.</li> 
        <li>To represent a single-quote <code>char</code>, you need to write <code>'\''</code> to distinguish it from the closing single-quote. But you can write double-quote directly, i.e., <code>'"'</code>.</li> 
        <li>To place a double-quote in a double-quoted string, you need to use <code>\"</code> to distinguish it from the closing double-quote, e.g., <code>"\"hello\""</code>. But you can write single-quote directly, e,g, <code>"'hello'"</code>.</li> 
       </ul></li> 
      <li>Other less commonly-used escape sequences are: <code>\a</code> for alert or bell, <code>\b</code> for backspace, <code>\f</code> for form-feed, <code>\v</code> for vertical tab. These may not be supported in some consoles.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h5>String Literals</h5> 
     <p>A <code>String</code> literal is composed of zero of more characters surrounded by a pair of <em>double quotes</em>, e.g., <code>"Hello, world!"</code>, <code>"The sum is: "</code>. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
String directionMsg = "Turn Right";
String greetingMsg = "Hello";
String statusMsg = "";   <span class="color-comment">// an empty string</span></pre> 
     <p>String literals may contains escape sequences. Inside a <code>String</code>, you need to use <code>\"</code> for double-quote to distinguish it from the ending double-quote, e.g. <code>"\"quoted\""</code>. Single-quote inside a <code>String</code> does not require escape sequence. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
System.out.println("Use \\\" to place\n a \" within\ta\tstring");</pre> 
     <pre class="output">
Use \" to place
 a " within	a	string</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Exercise:</span> Write a program to print the following animal picture using multiple <code>System.out.println()</code>. Take note that you need to use escape sequences to print special characters.</p>

     <h5><span class="font-code">boolean</span> Literals</h5> 
     <p>There are only two <code>boolean</code> literals, i.e., <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
boolean done = true;
boolean gameOver = false;</pre>

     </table> 
     <p>All these operators are <em>binary</em> operators, i.e., they take two operands. However, '+' and '-' can also be interpreted as <em>unary</em> "positive" and "negative" operators. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int number = -88;  <span class="color-comment">// negate</span>
int x = +5;        <span class="color-comment">// '+' optional</span></pre> 
     <h4>Arithmetic Expressions</h4> 
     <p>In programming, the following arithmetic expression:</p> 
     <img class="image-left" src="images/JavaBasics_ArithmeticExpression.png" alt="JavaBasics_ArithmeticExpression.png"> 
     <p>must be written as <code>(1+2*a)/3 + (4*(b+c)*(5-d-e))/f - 6*(7/g+h)</code>. You cannot omit the multiplication symbol (<code>*</code>), as in Mathematics.</p> 
     <h5>Rules on Precedence</h5> 
     <p>Like Mathematics:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>The multiplication (<code>*</code>), division (<code>/</code>) and remainder (<code>%</code>) take precedence over addition (<code>+</code>) and subtraction (<code>-</code>). For example, <code>1+2*3-4/2</code> is interpreted as <code>1+(2*3)-(4/2)</code>.</li> 
      <li>Unary <code>'+'</code> (positive) and <code>'-'</code> (negate) have higher precedence.</li> 
      <li>Parentheses <code>()</code> have the highest precedence and can be used to change the order of evaluation.</li> 
      <li>Within the same precedence level (e.g., addition and subtraction), the expression is evaluated from left to right (called <em>left-associative</em>). For example, <code>1+2-3+4</code> is evaluated as <code>((1+2)-3)+4</code> and <code>1*2%3/4</code> is <code>((1*2)%3)/4</code>.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <h4>Mixed-Type Operations</h4> 
     <p>The arithmetic operators are only applicable to <em>primitive numeric types</em>: <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>char</code>.<code> </code>These operators do not apply to <code>boolean</code>.</p> 
     <p>If both operands are <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code> or <code>double</code>, the arithmetic operations are carried in that type, and evaluated to a value of that type, i.e., <code>int 5 + int 6 ? int 11</code>; <code>double 2.1 + double 1.2 ? double 3.3</code>.</p> 
     <p>It is important to take note <code>int</code> division produces an <code>int</code>, i.e., <code>int/int ?</code><code> int</code>, with the result <em>truncated</em>, e.g., <code>1/2 ? 0</code>, instead of <code>0.5</code>?!</p> 
     <p>If both operand are <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code> or <code>char</code>, the operations are carried out in <code>int</code>, and evaluated to a value of <code>int</code>. A <code>char</code> is treated as a 16-bit <em>unsigned</em> integer in the range of <code>[0, 65535]</code>. For example, <code>byte 127 + byte 1 ? int 127 + int 1 ? int 128</code>.</p> 
     <p>If the two operands belong to <em>different types</em>, the value of the <em>smaller</em> type is promoted automatically to the <em>larger</em> type (known as <em>implicit type-casting</em>). The operation is then carried out in the <em>larger</em> type, and evaluated to a value in the <em>larger</em> type.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><code>byte</code>, <code>short</code> or <code>char</code> is first promoted to <code>int</code> before comparing with the type of the other operand.</li> 
      <li>The order of promotion is: <code>int ? long ? float ? double</code>.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>For examples,</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><code>int/double ? double/double ? double</code>. Hence, <code>1/2 ? 0, 1.0/2.0 ? 0.5, 1.0/2 ? 0.5, 1/2.0 ? 0.5</code>.</li> 
      <li><code>char + float ? int + float ? float + float ? float</code>.</li> 
      <li><code>9 / 5 * 20.1 ? (9 / 5) * 20.1 ? 1 * 20.1 ? 1.0 * 20.1 ? 20.1</code> (You probably don't expect this answer!)</li> 
      <li><code>byte 1 + byte 2 ? int 1 + int 2 ? int 3</code> (The result is an <code>int</code>, NOT <code>byte</code>!) <pre class="color-example">
byte b1 = 1, b2 = 2;
byte b3 = b1 + b2;  <span class="color-comment">// Compilation Error: possible loss of precision
                    // b1+b2 returns an int, cannot be assigned to byte</span></pre> </li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>The type-promotion rules for <em>binary</em> operations can be summarized as follows:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>If one of the operand is <code>double</code>, the other operand is promoted to <code>double</code>;</li> 
      <li>Else If one of the operand is <code>float</code>, the other operand is promoted to <code>float</code>;</li> 
      <li>Else If one of the operand is <code>long</code>, the other operand is promoted to <code>long</code>;</li> 
      <li>Else both operands are promoted to <code>int</code>.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>The type-promotion rules for <em>unary</em> operations (e.g., negate <code>'-'</code>) can be summarized as follows:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>If the operand is <code>double</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>long</code> or <code>int</code>, there is no promotion.</li> 
      <li>Else (the operand is <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>char</code>), the operand is promoted to <code>int</code>.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
byte b1 = 1;
byte b2 = -b1;  <span class="color-comment">// Compilation Error: possible loss of precision
                // -b1 returns an int, cannot be assigned to byte</span></pre> 
     <h5>Remainder (Modulus) Operator</h5> 
     <p>To evaluate the remainder (for negative and floating-point operands), perform repeated subtraction until the <em>absolute</em> value of the remainder is less than the <em>absolute</em> value of the second operand.</p> 
     <p>For example,</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><code>-5 % 2 ? -3 % 2 ? -1</code></li> 
      <li><code>5.5 % 2.2 ? 3.3 % 2.2 ? 1.1</code></li> 
     </ul> 
     <h5>Exponent?</h5> 
     <p>Java does not have an exponent operator. (The <code>'^'</code> operator is for exclusive-or, NOT exponent). You need to use method <code>Math.exp(x, y)</code> to evaluate <code>x</code> raises to power <code>y</code>.</p> 
     <h4>Overflow/Underflow</h4> 
     <p>Study the output of the following program:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">/*
 * Illustrate "int" overflow
 */</span>
public class <strong>Overflow<strong>Test</strong></strong> {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      <span class="color-comment">// Range of int is [-2147483648, 2147483647]</span>
      int i1 = 2147483647;  <span class="color-comment">// maximum int</span>
      System.out.println(i1 + 1);   <span class="color-comment">// -2147483648 (overflow!)</span>
      System.out.println(i1 + 2);   <span class="color-comment">// -2147483647</span>
      System.out.println(i1 * i1);  <span class="color-comment">// 1</span>
      
      int i2 = -2147483648;  <span class="color-comment">// minimum int</span>
      System.out.println(i2 - 1);   <span class="color-comment">// 2147483647 (overflow!)</span>
      System.out.println(i2 - 2);   <span class="color-comment">// 2147483646</span>
      System.out.println(i2 * i2);  <span class="color-comment">// 0</span>
   }
}</pre> 
     <p>In arithmetic operations, the resultant value <em>wraps around</em> if it exceeds its range (i.e., overflow). Java runtime does NOT issue an error/warning message but produces an <em>incorrect</em> result.</p> 
     <p>On the other hand, integer division produces an truncated integer and results in so-called <em>underflow</em>. For example, <code>1/2</code> gives <code>0</code>, instead of <code>0.5</code>. Again, Java runtime does NOT issue an error/warning message, but produces an <em>imprecise</em> result.</p> 
     <p>It is important to take note that <em>checking of overflow/underflow is the programmer's responsibility</em>. i.e., your job!!!</p> 
     <p>Why computer does not flag overflow/underflow as an error? This is due to the legacy design when the processors were very slow. Checking for overflow/underflow consumes computation power. Today, processors are fast. It is better to ask the computer to check for overflow/underflow (if you design a new language), because few humans expect such results.</p> 
     <p>To check for arithmetic overflow (known as <em>secure coding</em>) is tedious. Google for "INT32-C. Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result in overflow" @ www.securecoding.cert.org.</p> 
     <h4 id="typecasting">Type-Casting</h4> 
     <p>In Java, you will get a <em>compilation error</em> if you try to assign a <code>double</code> or <code>float</code> value of to an <code>int</code> variable. This is because the fractional part would be lost. The compiler issues an error "possible loss in precision". For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
double d = 3.5;
int i;
<span class="color-error">i = d;</span>            <span class="color-comment">// Compilation Error: possible loss of precision (assigning a double value to an int variable)</span>
<span class="color-error">int sum = 55.66f;</span> <span class="color-comment">// Compilation Error: possible loss of precision (assigning a float value to an int variable)</span></pre> 
     <h5>Explicit Type-Casting and Type-Casting Operator</h5> 
     <p>To assign the a <code>double</code> value to an <code>int</code> variable, you need to<em> </em>invoke the so-called <em>type-casting operator</em> - in the form of <code>(int)<em>value</em></code> - to operate on the <code>double</code> operand and return a <em>truncated</em> value in <code>int</code>. In other words, you tell the compiler you concisely perform the truncation and you are aware of the possible loss of precision. You can then assign the truncated <code>int</code> value to the <code>int</code> variable. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
double d = 3.5;
int i;
i = (int) d;    <span class="color-comment">// Cast double value of 3.5 to int 3. Assign the resultant value 3 to i</span>
                <span class="color-comment">// Casting from double to int <em>truncates</em>.</span></pre> 
     <p>Type-casting is an operation which takes one operand. It operates on its operand, and returns an equivalent value in the specified type.</p> 
     <p>There are two kinds of type-casting in Java:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>Explicit type-casting via a type-casting operator in the prefix form of <code>(<em>new-type</em>)<em>operand</em></code>, as described above, and</li> 
      <li>Implicit type-casting performed by the compiler automatically, if there is no loss of precision.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <h5>Implicit Type-Casting in Assignment</h5> 
     <p>Explicit type-casting is not required if you assign an <code>int</code> value to a <code>double</code> variable, because there is no loss of precision. The compiler will perform the type-casting automatically (i.e., implicit type-casting). For example,,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int i = 3;
double d;
d = i;           <span class="color-comment">// OK, no explicit type casting required</span>
                 <span class="color-comment">// d = 3.0</span>
d = (double) i;  <span class="color-comment">// Explicit type casting operator used here</span>
double aDouble = 55;   <span class="color-comment">// Compiler auto-casts int 55 to double 55.0</span>
double nought = 0;     <span class="color-comment">// Compiler auto-casts int 0 to double 0.0
                       // int 0 and double 0.0 are different.</span></pre> 
     <p>The following diagram shows the order of implicit type-casting performed by compiler. The rule is to promote the smaller type to a bigger type to prevent loss of precision, known as widening conversion. Narrowing conversion requires explicit type-cast to inform the compiler that you are aware of the possible loss of precision. Take note that <code>char</code> is treated as an 16-bit unsigned integer in the range of <code>[0, 65535]</code>. <code>boolean</code> value cannot be type-casted (i.e., converted to non-<code>boolean</code>).</p> 
     <img class="image-center" src="images/JavaBasics_ImplicitTypeCastingPrimitives.png" alt="JavaBasics_ImplicitTypeCastingPrimitives.png"> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example</span>: Suppose that you want to find the average (in <code>double</code>) of the integers between <code>1</code> and <code>100</code>. Study the following codes:</p>

public class Sum1To100 {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int sum = 0;
      double average;
      int number = 1;
      while (number &lt;= 100) {
         sum += number;     <span class="color-comment"> // Final sum is int 5050</span>
         ++number;
      }
      average = sum / 100;  <span class="color-comment"> // Won't work (average = 50.0 instead of 50.5)</span>
      System.out.println("Average is " + average); <span class="color-comment"> // Average is 50.0</span>
   }
}</pre> </td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody> 
     </table> 
     <p>This is because both the <code>sum</code> and <code>100</code> are <code>int</code>. The result of division is an <code>int</code>, which is then implicitly casted to <code>double</code> and assign to the <code>double</code> variable <code>average</code>. To get the correct answer, you can do either:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
average = (double)sum / 100;     <span class="color-comment">// Cast sum from int to double before division</span>
average = sum / (double)100;     <span class="color-comment">// Cast 100 from int to double before division</span>

average = (double)(sum / 100);   <span class="color-comment">// Won't work. why?</span></pre>

     <h4>Increment/Decrement</h4> 
     <p>Java supports these <em>unary</em> arithmetic operators: increment (<code>++</code>) and decrement (<code>--</code>) for all numeric primitive types (<code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>, except <code>boolean</code>).</p>

     <p>The increment (<code>++</code>) and decrement (<code>--</code>) operate on its operand and store the result back to its operand. For example, <code>x++</code> retrieves x, increment and stores the result back to x. Writing <code>x = x++</code> is a logical error!!!</p> 
     <p>Unlike other unary operator (such as negate (<code>-</code>)) which promotes <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code> and <code>char</code> to <code>int</code>, the increment and decrement do not promote its operand (because there is no such need).</p> 
     <p>The increment/decrement unary operator can be placed before the operand (prefix), or after the operands (postfix), which affects its <em>resultant value</em>.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>If these operators are used by themselves (e.g., <code>x++</code> or <code>++x</code>), the outcomes are the same for pre- and post-operators, because the resultant values are discarded.</li> 
      <li>If '++' or '--' involves another operation (e.g., <code>y=x++</code> or <code>y=++x</code>), then pre- or post-order is important to specify the order of the two operations:</li>

     <p>In Java, these comparison operations returns a <code>boolean</code> value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p> 
     <p>Each comparison operation involves two operands, e.g., <code>x &lt;= 100</code>. It is invalid to write <code>1 &lt; x &lt; 100</code> in programming. Instead, you need to break out the two comparison operations <code>x &gt; 1</code>, <code>x &lt; 100</code>, and join with with a logical AND operator, i.e., <code>(x &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; (x &lt; 100)</code>, where <code>&amp;&amp;</code> denotes AND operator.</p> 
     <p>Java provides four logical operators, which operate on <code>boolean</code> operands only, in descending order of precedences, as follows:</p>

     <h5>Operator Precedence</h5>

     <h5>Short-Circuit Operation</h5> 
     <p>The logical AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) and OR (<code>||</code>) operators are known as short-circuit operators, meaning that the right operand will not be evaluated if the result can be determined by the left operand. For example, <code>false &amp;&amp; ...</code> gives <code>false</code>; <code>true || ...</code> give <code>true</code> without evaluating the right operand. This may have adverse consequences if you rely on the right operand to perform certain operations, e.g. <code>false &amp;&amp; (++i &lt; 5)</code> but <code>++i</code> will not be evaluated.</p> 
     <h3><span class="font-code">String</span>s</h3> 
     <p>A <code>String</code> is a sequence of characters. A string literal is surrounded by a pair of double quotes, e.g.,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
String s1 = "Hi, This is a string!"  <span class="color-comment">// String literals are enclosed in double quotes</span>
String s2 = ""                       <span class="color-comment">// An empty string</span></pre> 
     <p>You need to use an escape sequence for special control characters (such as newline <code>\n</code> and tab <code>\t</code>), double-quote <code>\"</code> and backslash <code>\\</code> (due to conflict) and Unicode character <code>\u<em>hhhh</em></code> (if your editor does not support Unicode input), e.g.,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
String s3 = "A \"string\" nested \\inside\\ a string"
String s4 = "Hello, \u60a8\u597d!"   <span class="color-comment">// "Hello, ??!"</span></pre> 
     <p>Single-quote (<code>'</code>) does not require an escape sign.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
String s5 = "Hi, I'm a string!"      <span class="color-comment">// Single quote OK</span></pre> 
     <h4><span class="font-code">String</span> and <span class="font-code">'+'</span> Operator</h4> 
     <p>In Java, <code>'+'</code> is a special operator. It is <em>overloaded</em>. <em>Overloading</em> means that it carries out different operations depending on the types of its two operands.</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>If both operands are numbers (<code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>char</code>), <code>'+'</code> performs the usual <em>addition</em>, e.g., <pre class="color-example">
1 + 2 ? 3
1.2 + 2.2 ? 3.4
1 + 2.2 ? 1.0 + 2.2 ? 3.2</pre></li> 
      <li>If both operands are <code>String</code>s, <code>'+'</code> <em>concatenates</em> the two Strings and returns the concatenated <code>String</code>. E.g., <pre class="color-example">
"Hello" + "world" ? "Helloworld"
"Hi" + ", " + "world" + "!" ? "Hi, world!"</pre></li> 
      <li>If one of the operand is a <code>String</code> and the other is numeric, the numeric operand will be converted to <code>String</code> and the two <code>String</code>s concatenated, e.g., <pre class="color-example">
"The number is " + 5 ? "The number is " + "5" ? "The number is 5"
"The average is " + average + "!" (suppose average=5.5) ? "The average is " + "5.5" + "!" ? "The average is 5.5!"
"How about " + a + b (suppose a=1, b=1) ? "How about 11"</pre></li> 
     </ul> 
     <h4><span class="font-code">String</span> Operations</h4> 
     <p>The most commonly-used <code>String</code> methods are:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><code>length()</code>: return the length of the string.</li> 
      <li><code>charAt(int index)</code>: return the <code>char</code> at the <code>index</code> position (index begins at <code>0</code> to <code>length()-1</code>).</li> 
      <li><code>equals()</code>: for comparing the contents of two strings. Take note that you cannot use <code>"=="</code> to compare two strings.</li> 
     </ul>

     <h3>Flow Control</h3> 
     <p>There are three basic flow control constructs - <em>sequential</em>, <em>conditional</em> (or <em>decision</em>), and <em>loop</em> (or <em>iteration</em>), as illustrated below.</p> 
     <img class="image-center" src="images/Flowchart_FlowControl.png" alt="structure constructs"> 
     <h4>Sequential Flow Control</h4> 
     <p>A program is a sequence of instructions executing one after another in a predictable manner. <em>Sequential</em> flow is the most common and straight-forward, where programming statements are executed in the order that they are written - from top to bottom in a sequential manner.</p> 
     <h4>Conditional Flow Control</h4> 
     <p>There are a few types of conditionals, <em>if-then</em>, <em>if-then-else</em>, <em>nested-if</em> (<em>if-elseif-elseif-...-else</em>), <em>switch-case</em>, and <em>conditional expression</em>.</p>

(JDK 1.7 supports <code>String</code> as the case-selector).</p> 
     <h4>Conditional Operator (<span class="font-code">? :</span>)</h4> 
     <p>A conditional operator is a ternary (3-operand) operator, in the form of <code><em>booleanExpr</em> ? <em>trueExpr</em> : <em>falseExpr</em></code>.

     <p>The difference between <em>while-do</em> and <em>do-while</em> lies in the order of the <em>body</em> and <em>condition</em>. In <em>while-do</em>, the <em>condition</em> is tested first. The body will be executed if the <em>condition</em> is true and the process repeats. In <em>do-while</em>, the <em>body</em> is executed and then the <em>condition</em> is tested. Take note that the <em>body</em> of <em>do-while</em> will be executed at least once vs. possibly zero for <em>while-do</em>. Similarly, the for-loop's body could possibly not executed.</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example:</span> Suppose that your program prompts user for a number between <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>, and checks for valid input. A do-while loop with a <code>boolean</code> flag could be more appropriate as it prompts for input at least once, and repeat again and again if the input is invalid.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">// Input with validity check</span>
boolean valid = false;

     valid = true;
  }
} while (!valid);   <span class="color-comment">// Need a semi-colon to terminate do-while</span></pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example:</span> Below is an example of using while-do with a <code>boolean</code> flag. The <code>boolean</code> flag is initialized to <code>false</code> to ensure that the loop is entered.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">

     <h5>Empty for-loop</h5> 
     <p><code>for ( ; ; ) { <em>body</em> }</code> is known as an <em>empty for-loop</em>, with empty statement for initialization, test and post-processing. The body of the empty for-loop will execute continuously (infinite loop). You need to use a <code>break</code> statement to break out the loop.</p> 
     <h5>for-loop with Comma Separator</h5> 
     <p>You could place more than one statement in the initialization and post-processing, separated with commas (instead of the usual semi-colon). For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
for (int row = 0, col = 0; row &lt; SIZE; ++row, ++col) {

     <h5>Labeled <span class="font-code">break</span></h5> 
     <p>In a nested loop, the <code>break</code> statement breaks out the innermost loop and continue into the outer loop. At times, there is a need to break out all the loops (or multiple loops). This is clumsy to achieve with <code>boolean</code> flag, but can be done easily via the so-called labeled <code>break</code>. You can add a <code>label</code> to a loop in the form of <code><em>labelName</em>: <em>loop</em></code>. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
level1:          <span class="color-comment">// define a label for the level-1 loop</span>
for (.....) {
level2:          <span class="color-comment">// define a label for the level-2 loop</span>
   for (.....) {
      for (......) {  <span class="color-comment">// level-3 loop</span>
         if (...) break level1;  <span class="color-comment">// break all loops, continue after the loop</span>
         if (...) break level2:  <span class="color-comment">// continue into the next statement of level-1 loop</span>
         ......
      }
   }
}</pre> 
     <h5>Labeled <span class="font-code">continue</span></h5> 
     <p>In a nested loop, similar to labeled <code>break</code>, you can use labeled continue to continue into a specified loop. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
level1:          <span class="color-comment">// define a label (with : suffix) for the level-1 loop</span>
for (.....) {
level2:          <span class="color-comment">// define a label (with : suffix) for the level-2 loop</span>
   for (.....) {
      for (......) {  <span class="color-comment">// level-3 loop</span>
         if (...) continue level1;  <span class="color-comment">// continue the next iteration of level-1 loop</span>
         if (...) continue level2:  <span class="color-comment">// continue the next iteration of level-2 loop</span>
         ......
      }
   }
}</pre> 
     <p>Again, labeled <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> are not structured and hard to read. Use them only if absolutely necessary.</p>

     <h4>Some Issues in Flow Control</h4> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Dangling Else</span><strong>:</strong> The "dangling else" problem can be illustrated as follows:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
if (i == 0)
   if (j == 0)
      System.out.println("i and j are zero");
else System.out.println("i is not zero");   <span class="color-comment">// intend for the outer-if</span></pre> 
     <p>The <code>else</code> clause in the above codes is syntactically applicable to both the outer-if and the inner-if. Java compiler always associate the <code>else</code> clause with the innermost if (i.e., the nearest if). Dangling else can be resolved by applying explicit parentheses. The above codes are logically incorrect and require explicit parentheses as shown below.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
if ( i == 0) {
   if (j == 0) System.out.println("i and j are zero");
} else {
   System.out.println("i is not zero");   <span class="color-comment">// non-ambiguous for outer-if</span>
}</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Endless loop</span><strong>:</strong> The following constructs:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
while (true) { ...... }</pre> 
     <p>is commonly used. It seems to be an endless loop (or infinite loop), but it is usually terminated via a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> statement inside the loop body. This kind of code is hard to read - avoid if possible by re-writing the condition.</p> 
     <h3>Writing Correct and Good Programs</h3> 
     <p>It is important to write programs that produce the correct results. It is also important to write programs that others (and you yourself three days later) can understand, so that the programs can be maintained - I call these programs good programs - a good program is more than a correct program.</p> 
     <p>Here are the suggestions:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Follow established convention so that everyone has the same basis of understanding. To program in Java, you MUTST read the "<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html">Code Convention for the Java Programming Language</a>".</li> 
      <li>Format and layout of the source code with appropriate indents, white spaces and white lines. Use 3 or 4 spaces for indent, and blank lines to separate sections of codes.</li> 
      <li>Choose good names that are self-descriptive and meaningful, e.g., <code>row</code>, <code>col</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>xMax</code>, <code>numStudents</code>. Do not use meaningless names, such as <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>. Avoid single-alphabet names (easier to type but often meaningless), except common names likes x, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code> for co-ordinates and <code>i</code> for index.</li> 
      <li>Provide comments to explain the important as well as salient concepts. Comment your codes liberally.</li> 
      <li>Write your program documentation while writing your programs.</li> 
      <li>Avoid <em>un-structured</em> constructs, such as <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>, which are hard to follow.</li> 
      <li> Use "mono-space" fonts (such as Consolas, Courier New, Courier) for writing/displaying your program.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>It is estimated that over the lifetime of a program, 20 percent of the effort will go into the original creation and testing of the code, and 80 percent of the effort will go into the subsequent maintenance and enhancement. Writing good programs which follow standard conventions is critical in the subsequent maintenance and enhancement!!!</p> 
     <h4>Programming Errors</h4> 
     <p>There are generally three classes of programming errors:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><em>Compilation Error</em> (or <em>Syntax Error</em>): can be fixed easily.</li> 
      <li><em>Runtime Error</em>: program halts pre-maturely without producing the results - can also be fixed easily.</li> 
      <li><em>Logical Error</em>: program completes but produces incorrect results. It is easy to detect if the program always produces wrong result. It is extremely hard to fix if the program produces the correct result most of the times, but incorrect result sometimes. For example, <pre class="color-example">
<span class="color-comment">// Can compile and execute, but give wrong result  sometimes!</span>
if (mark &gt; 50) {
   System.out.println("PASS");
} else {
   System.out.println("FAIL");
}</pre> This kind of errors is very serious if it is not caught before production. Writing good programs helps in minimizing and detecting these errors. A good <em>testing strategy</em> is needed to ascertain the correctness of the program. <em>Software testing</em> is an advanced topics which is beyond our current scope.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <h4>Debugging Programs</h4> 
     <p>Here are the common debugging techniques:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>Stare at the screen! Unfortunately, errors usually won't pop-up even if you stare at it extremely hard.</li> 
      <li>Study the error messages! Do not close the console when error occurs and pretending that everything is fine. This helps most of the times.</li> 
      <li>Insert print statements at appropriate locations to display the intermediate results. It works for simple toy program, but it is neither effective nor efficient for complex program.</li> 
      <li>Use a graphic debugger. This is the most effective means. Trace program execution step-by-step and watch the value of variables and outputs.</li> 
      <li>Advanced tools such as profiler (needed for checking memory leak and method usage).</li> 
      <li>Proper program testing to wipe out the logical errors.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <h4>Testing Your Program for Correctness</h4> 
     <p>How to ensure that your program always produces correct result, 100% of the times? It is impossible to try out all the possible outcomes, even for a simple program. Program testing usually involves a set of representative test cases, which are designed to catch the major classes of errors. Program testing is beyond the scope of this writing.</p> 
     <h3>Input/Output</h3> 
     <h4>Formatted Output via "<span class="font-code">printf()</span>" (JDK 1.5)</h4> 
     <p><code>System.out.print()</code> and <code>println()</code> do not provide output formatting, such as controlling the number of spaces to print an <code>int</code> and the number of decimal places for a <code>double</code>.</p> 
     <p>Java SE 5 introduced a new method called <code>printf()</code> for formatted output (which is modeled after C Language's <code>printf()</code>). <code>printf()</code> takes the following form:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">printf(<em>formatting-string</em>, <em>arg1</em>, <em>arg2</em>, <em>arg3</em>, ... );</pre> 
     <p><em>Formatting-string</em> contains both <em>normal texts</em> and the so-called <em>Format Specifier</em>s. Normal texts (including white spaces) will be printed as they are. Format specifiers, in the form of "<code>%[flags][width]conversion-code</code>", will be substituted by the arguments following the formatting-string, usually in a one-to-one and sequential manner. A format specifier begins with a <code>'%'</code> and ends with the conversion code, e.g., <code>%d</code> for integer, <code>%f</code> for floating-point number, <code>%c</code> for character and <code>%s</code> for string. Optional <code>[width]</code> can be inserted in between to specify the field-width. Similarly, optional <code>[flags]</code> can be used to control the alignment, padding and others. For examples,</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><code>%?d</code>: integer printed in ? spaces (? is optional).</li> 
      <li><code>%?s</code>: String printed in ? spaces (? is optional). If ? is omitted, the number of spaces is the length of the string (to fit the string).</li> 
      <li><code>%?.?f</code>: Floating point number (<code>float</code> and <code>double</code>) printed in ? spaces with ? decimal digits (? and ? are optional).</li> 
      <li><code>%n</code>: a system-specific new line (Windows uses <code>"\r\n"</code>, Unix and Mac <code>"\n"</code>).</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h5>Examples:</h5> 
     <pre class="color-command">
System.out.printf("Hello%2d and %6s", 8, "HI!!!%n");</pre> 
     <pre class="output">
Hello*8 and ****HI!!!   <span class="color-comment">// * denotes white-spaces inserted by format specifier</span></pre> 
     <pre class="color-command">
System.out.printf("Hi,%s%4d%n", "Hello", 88);</pre> 
     <pre class="output">
Hi,Hello**88</pre> 
     <pre class="color-command">
System.out.printf("Hi, %d %4.2f%n", 8, 5.556);</pre> 
     <pre class="output">
Hi, 8 5.56</pre> 
     <pre class="color-command">
System.out.printf("Hi,%-4s&amp;%6.2f%n", "Hi", 5.5);  <span class="color-comment">// '%-ns' for left-align String</span></pre> 
     <pre class="output">
Hi,Hi**&amp;**5.50</pre> 
     <pre class="color-command">
System.out.printf("Hi, Hi, %.4f%n", 5.56);</pre> 
     <pre class="output">
Hi, Hi, 5.5600</pre> 
     <p>Take note that <code>printf()</code> does not advance the cursor to the next line after printing. You need to explicitly print a newline character at the end of the formatting-string to advance the cursor to the next line, if desires. [In C program, we often use '\n' to print a newline, which results in non-portable program. You should use format specifier "<code>%n</code>" instead.]</p> 
     <p>There are many more format specifiers in Java. Refer to JDK Documentation for the detailed descriptions.</p> 
     <p>(Also take note that <code>printf()</code> take a variable number of arguments (or <em>varargs</em>), which is a new feature introduced in JDK 1.5 in order to support <code>printf()</code>)</p> 
     <h4>Input From Keyboard via "<span class="font-code">Scanner</span>" (JDK 1.5)</h4> 
     <p>Java, like all other languages, supports three standard input/output streams: <code>System.in</code> (standard input device), <code>System.out</code> (standard output device), and <code>System.err</code> (standard error device). The <code>System.in</code> is defaulted to be the keyboard; while <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code> are defaulted to the console. They can be <em>re-directed</em> to other devices, e.g., it is quite common to redirect <code>System.err</code> to a disk file to save these error message.</p> 
     <p>You can read input from keyboard via <code>System.in</code> (standard input device).</p> 
     <p>Java SE 5 introduced a new class called <code>Scanner</code> in package <code>java.util</code> to simplify <em>formatted input</em> (and a new method <code>printf()</code> for formatted output described earlier). You can construct a <code>Scanner</code> to <em>scan</em> input from <code>System.in</code> (keyboard), and use methods such as <code>nextInt()</code>, <code>nextDouble()</code>, <code>next()</code> to <em>parse</em> the next <code>int</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>String</code> token (delimited by white space of blank, tab and newline).</p>

     <p>Try not to mix <code>nextLine()</code> and <code>nextInt()|nextDouble()|next()</code> in a program (as you may need to flush the newline from the input buffer).</p> 
     <p>The <code>Scanner</code> supports many other input formats. Check the JDK documentation page, under package <code>java.util</code> ? class <code>Scanner</code> ? Method.</p> 
     <h4>Input from Text File via "<span class="font-code">Scanner</span>" (JDK 1.5)</h4> 
     <p>Other than scanning <code>System.in</code> (keyboard), you can connect your <code>Scanner</code> to scan any input source, such as <em>a disk file</em> or <em>a network socket</em>, and use the same set of methods <code>nextInt()</code>, <code>nextDouble()</code>, <code>next()</code>, <code>nextLine()</code> to parse the next <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>String</code> and line. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
Scanner in = new Scanner(new File("in.txt"));  <span class="color-comment">// Construct a Scanner to scan a text file</span>
<span class="color-comment">// Use the same set of methods</span>
int anInt = in.nextInt();         <span class="color-comment">// next String</span>
double aDouble = in.nextDouble(); <span class="color-comment">// next double</span>
String str = in.next();           <span class="color-comment">// next int</span>
String line = in.nextLine();      <span class="color-comment">// entire line</span></pre> 
     <p>To open a file via <code>new File(<em>filename</em>)</code>, you need to handle the so-called <code>FileNotFoundException</code>, i.e., the file that you are trying to open cannot be found. Otherwise, you cannot compile your program. There are two ways to handle this exception: <em>throws</em> or <em>try-catch</em>.</p>

     <h4>Formatted Output to Text File</h4> 
     <p>Java SE 5.0 also introduced a so-called <code>Formatter</code> for formatted output (just like <code>Scanner</code> for formatted input). A <code>Formatter</code> has a method called <code>format()</code>. The <code>format()</code> method has the same syntax as <code>printf()</code>, i.e., it could use format specifiers to specify the format of the arguments. Again, you need to handle the <code>FileNotFoundException</code>.</p>

     <p>To use the new <code>Console</code> class, you first use <code>System.console()</code> to retrieve the <code>Console</code> object corresponding to the current system console.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
Console con = System.console();</pre> 
     <p>You can then use methods such as <code>readLine()</code> to read a line. You can optionally include a prompting message with format specifiers (e.g., <code>%d</code>, <code>%s</code>) in the prompting message.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">

     <h4>Exercises on Input/Output</h4> 
     <p><a href="J2a_BasicsExercises.html#ExerciseInput">LINK TO EXERCISE ON INPUT</a></p> 
     <h3>Arrays</h3> 
     <p>Suppose that you want to find the average of the marks for a class of 30 students, you certainly do not want to create 30 variables: <code>mark1</code>, <code>mark2</code>, ..., <code>mark30</code>. Instead, You could use a single variable, called an <em>array</em>, with 30 elements.</p> 
     <p>An array is <em>an ordered collection of elements of the same type</em>, identified by a pair of square brackets <code>[ ]</code>. To use an array, you need to:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><em>Declare</em> the array with a <em>name</em> and a <em>type</em>. Use a plural name for array, e.g., <code>marks</code>, <code>rows</code>, <code>numbers</code>. All elements of the array belong to the same type.</li> 
      <li><em>Allocate</em> the array using <code>new</code> operator, or through <em>initialization</em>, e.g., <pre class="color-example">
int[] marks;  <span class="color-comment">// Declare an int array named marks
              // marks contains a special value called null.</span>
int marks[];  <span class="color-comment">// Same as above, but the above syntax recommended</span>
marks = new int[5];   <span class="color-comment">// Allocate 5 elements via the "new" operator</span>
<span class="color-comment">// Declare and allocate a 20-element array in one statement via "new" operator</span>
int[] factors = new int[20];
<span class="color-comment">// Declare, allocate a 6-element array thru initialization</span>
int[] numbers = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66}; <span class="color-comment">// size of array deduced from the number of items</span></pre> </li> 
     </ol> 
     <p>When an array is constructed via the <code>new</code> operator, all the elements are initialized to their default value, e.g., <code>0</code> for <code>int</code>, <code>0.0</code> for <code>double</code>, <code>false</code> for <code>boolean</code>, and <code>null</code> for objects. [Unlike C/C++, which does NOT initialize the array contents.]</p> 
     <p>When an array is declared but not allocated, it contains a special value called <code>null</code>.</p> 
     <p>You can refer to an element of an array via an index (or subscript) enclosed within the square bracket <code>[ ]</code>. Java's array index begins with zero (<code>0</code>). For example, suppose that <code>marks</code> is an <code>int</code> array of 5 elements, then the 5 elements are: <code>marks[0]</code>, <code>marks[1]</code>, <code>marks[2]</code>, <code>marks[3]</code>, and <code>marks[4]</code>.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int[] marks = new int[5];   <span class="color-comment">// Declare &amp; allocate a 5-element int array</span>
<span class="color-comment">// Assign values to the elements</span>
marks[0] = 95;
marks[1] = 85;
marks[2] = 77;
marks[3] = 69;
marks[4] = 66;
System.out.println(marks[0]);
System.out.println(marks[3] + marks[4]);</pre> 
     <p>To create an array, you need to known the length (or size) of the array in advance, and allocate accordingly. Once an array is created, its length is fixed and cannot be changed. At times, it is hard to ascertain the length of an array (e.g., how many students?). Nonetheless, you need to estimate the length and allocate an upper bound. This is probably the major drawback of using an array.</p> 
     <p>In Java, the length of array is kept in an <em>associated variable</em> called <code>length</code> and can be retrieved using "<code><em>arrayName</em>.length</code>", e.g.,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int[] factors = new int[5];       <span class="color-comment">// Declare and allocate a 5-element int array</span>
int numFactors = factors.length;  <span class="color-comment">// numFactor is 5</span></pre> 
     <img class="image-float-right" src="images/JavaBasics_array.gif" alt="array"> 
     <p>The index of an array is between <code>0</code> and <code><em>arrayName</em>.length - 1</code>.</p> 
     <p>Unlike languages like C/C++, Java performs array <em>index-bound check</em> at the <em>runtime</em>. In other words, for each reference to an array element, the index is checked against the array's length. If the index is outside the range of <code>[0, arrayName.legnth-1]</code>, the Java Runtime will signal an exception called <code> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException</code>. It is important to note that checking array index-bound consumes computation power, which inevitably slows down the processing. However, the benefits gained in terms of good software engineering out-weight the slow down in speed.</p> 
     <h4>Array and Loop</h4> 
     <p>Arrays works hand-in-hand with loops. You can process all the elements of an array via a loop, for example,</p> 
     <table class="table-program"> 
      <colgroup>
       <col class="col-line-number"> 
       <col class="col-program">

     <p>JDK 1,5 introduces a new loop syntax known as <em>enhanced for-loop</em> (or <em>for-each</em> loop) to facilitate processing of arrays and collections. It takes the following syntax:</p> 
     <table class="table-program"> 
      <tbody>
       <tr> 
        <th>Syntax</th> 
        <th>Example</th> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td> <pre class="color-syntax">
<strong>for (</strong> <em>type item</em> <strong>:</strong> <em>anArray</em> <strong>) {</strong>
   <em>body</em> <strong>;
}</strong>
<span class="color-comment">// <em>type</em> must be the same as the
// <em>anArray</em>'s type</span>
&nbsp;</pre></td> 
        <td> <pre class="color-explanation">int[] numbers = {8, 2, 6, 4, 3};
int sum = 0;
for (int number : numbers) {   <span class="color-comment">// for each int number in int[] numbers</span>
   sum += number;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);</pre> </td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody>
     </table> 
     <p>It shall be read as "for each element in the array...". The loop executes once for each element in the array, with the element's value copied into the declared variable. The for-each loop is handy to transverse all the elements of an array or a collection. It requires fewer lines of codes, eliminates the loop counter and the array index, and is easier to read. However, for array of primitive types (e.g., array of <code>int</code>s), it can <em>read</em> the elements only, and cannot <em>modify</em> the array's contents. This is because each element's value is copied into the loop's variable (pass-by-value), instead of working on its original copy.</p> 
     <p>In many situations, you merely want to transverse thru the array and read each of the elements. For these cases, enhanced for-loop is preferred and recommended over other loop constructs.</p> 
     <h4>Exercises on Arrays</h4> 
     <p><a href="J2a_BasicsExercises.html#ExerciseArray">LINK TO EXERCISES ON ARRAY</a></p> 
     <h4>Multi-Dimensional Array</h4> 
     <p>In Java, you can declare an array of arrays. For examples:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int grid[][] = new int[12][8];   <span class="color-comment">// a 12×8 grid of int</span>
grid[0][0] = 8;
grid[1][1] = 5;
System.out.println(grid.length);      <span class="color-comment">// 12</span>
System.out.println(grid[0].length);   <span class="color-comment">// 8</span>
System.out.println(grid[11].length);  <span class="color-comment">// 8</span></pre> 
     <p>In the above example, <code>grid</code> is an array of 12 elements. Each of the elements (<code>grid[0]</code> to <code>grid[11]</code>) is an 8-element <code>int</code> array. In other words, <code>grid</code> is a "12-element array" of "8-element int arrays". Hence, <code>grid.length</code> gives <code>12</code> and <code>grid[0].length</code> gives <code>8</code>.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
public class <strong>Array2DTest</strong> {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int[][] grid = new int[12][8];   <span class="color-comment">// A 12x8 grid, in [row][col] or [y][x]</span>
      int numRows = grid.length;       <span class="color-comment">// 12</span>
      int numCols = grid[0].length;    <span class="color-comment">// 8</span>
   
      <span class="color-comment">// Fill in grid</span>
      for (int row = 0; row &lt; numRows; ++row) {
         for (int col = 0; col &lt; numCols; ++col) {
            grid[row][col] = row*numCols + col + 1;
         }
      }
   
      <span class="color-comment">// Print grid</span>
      for (int row = 0; row &lt; numRows; ++row) {
         for (int col = 0; col &lt; numCols; ++col) {
            System.out.printf("%3d", grid[row][col]);
         }
         System.out.println();
      }
   }
}</pre> 
     <img class="image-float-right" src="images\Array_MultiDimensional.png" alt="Array_MultiDimensional.png"> 
     <p>To be precise, Java does not support multi-dimensional array directly. That is, it does not support syntax like <code>grid[3, 2]</code> like some languages. Furthermore, it is possible that the arrays in an array-of-arrays have different length.</p> 
     <p>Take note that the right way to view the "array of arrays" is as shown, instead of treating it as a 2D table, even if all the arrays have the same length.</p>

     <h3>Methods (Functions)</h3> 
     <h4>Why Methods?</h4> 
     <p>At times, a certain portion of codes has to be used many times. Instead of re-writing the codes many times, it is better to put them into a "subroutine", and "call" this "subroutine" many time - for ease of maintenance and understanding. Subroutine is called method (in Java) or function (in C/C++).</p> 
     <p>The benefits of using methods are:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><em>Divide and conquer</em>: construct the program from simple, small pieces or components. Modularize the program into self-contained tasks.</li> 
      <li><em>Avoid repeating codes</em>: It is easy to copy and paste, but hard to maintain and synchronize all the copies.</li> 
      <li><em>Software Reuse</em>: you can reuse the methods in other programs, by packaging them into library codes.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <h4>Using Methods</h4> 
     <p>Two parties are involved in using a method: a <em>caller</em>, who <em>calls</em> or <em>invokes</em> the method, and the <em>method</em> called.</p> 
     <p>The process is:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li>The caller invokes a method and passes <em>arguments</em> to the method.</li> 
      <li>The method: 
       <ol> 
        <li>receives the arguments passed by the caller,</li> 
        <li>performs the programmed operations defined in the method's body, and</li> 
        <li>returns a result back to the caller.</li> 
       </ol> </li> 
      <li>The caller receives the result, and continue its operations.</li> 
     </ol> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example:</span> Suppose that we need to evaluate the area of a circle many times, it is better to write a method called <code>getArea()</code>, and re-use it when needed.</p>

area 3 is 34.21194399759284</pre> 
     <p>In the above example, a reusable method called <code>getArea()</code> is defined, which receives an argument in <code>double</code> from the caller, performs the calculation, and return a <code>double</code> result to the caller. In the <code>main()</code>, we invoke <code>getArea()</code> methods thrice, each time with a different parameter.</p> 
     <p>Take note that there is a transfer of control from the caller to the method called, and from the method back to the caller, as illustrated.</p> 
     <img class="image-center" src="images/MethodTransferControl.png" alt="Method.png"> 
     <h5>Tracing Method Invocation</h5> 
     <p>You can trace method operations under Eclipse/NetBeans:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><strong>Step Over</strong>: Treat the method call as one single step.</li> 
      <li><strong>Step Into</strong>: Step into the method, so that you can trace the operations of the method.</li> 
      <li><strong>Step Out</strong>: Complete the current method and return to the caller.</li> 
      <li>Set "<strong>Breakpoints</strong>" inside the method, and "resume" running to the first breakpoint.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h5>Method Definition Syntax</h5> 
     <p>The syntax for method definition is as follows:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
<strong>public static</strong> <em>returnValueTyp</em>e <em>methodName </em><strong>(</strong> <em>arg-1-type arg-1</em>, <em>arg-2-type arg-2</em>,... <strong>) {</strong>
   <em>body</em> <strong>;
}</strong></pre> 
     <h5>Method Naming Convention</h5> 
     <p>A method's name shall be a verb or verb phrase (action), comprising one or more words. The first word is in lowercase, while the rest are initial-capitalized (called <em>camel-case</em>). For example, <code>getArea()</code>, <code>setRadius()</code>, <code>moveDown()</code>, <code>isPrime()</code>, etc.</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Another Example:</span></p>

      max = max(a, b);  <span class="color-comment">// invoke method max() with arguments</span>
      min = min(a, b);  <span class="color-comment">// invoke method min() with arguments</span>

   }

   <span class="color-comment">// The min() method returns the minimum of two given numbers</span>
   public static int min(int number1, int number2) {
      return (number1 &lt; number2) ? number1 : number2;
   }
}</pre> 
     <h4>The "<span class="font-code">return</span>" statement</h4> 
     <p>Inside the method body, you could use a <code>return</code> statement to return a value (of the <code><em>returnValueType</em></code> declared in the method's signature) to return a value back to the caller. The syntax is:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
return <em>aReturnValue</em>;   <span class="color-comment">// of <em>returnValueType</em> declared in method's signature</span>
return;                <span class="color-comment">// return nothing (or void)</span></pre> 
     <h4>The "<span class="font-code">void</span>" Return-Type</h4> 
     <p>Suppose that you need a method to perform certain actions (e.g., printing) without a need to return a value to the caller, you can declare its return-value type as <code>void</code>. In the method's body, you could use a "<code>return;</code>" statement without a return value to return control to the caller. In this case, the <code>return</code> statement is optional. If there is no <code>return</code> statement, the entire body will be executed, and control returns to the caller at the end of the body.</p> 
     <p>Notice that <code>main()</code> is a method with a return-value type of <code>void</code>. <code>main()</code> is called by the Java runtime, perform the actions defined in the body, and return nothing back to the Java runtime.</p> 
     <h4>Actual Parameters vs. Formal Parameters</h4> 
     <p>Recall that a method receives arguments from its caller, performs the actions defined in the method's body, and return a value (or nothing) to the caller.</p> 
     <p>In the above example, the variable <code>(double radius)</code> declared in the signature of <code>getArea(double radius)</code> is known as <em>formal parameter</em>. Its scope is within the method's body. When the method is invoked by a caller, the caller must supply so-called <em>actual parameter</em>s or <em>arguments</em>, whose value is then used for the actual computation. For example, when the method is invoked via "<code>area1=getArea(radius1)</code>", <code>radius1</code> is the actual parameter, with a value of <code>1.1</code>.</p> 
     <h4>Pass-by-Value for Primitive-Type Parameters</h4> 
     <p>In Java, when an argument of primitive type is pass into a method, a <em>copy</em> is created and passed into the method. The invoked method works on the <em>cloned copy</em>, and cannot modify the original copy. This is known as <em>pass-by-value</em>.</p> 
     <p>For example,</p>

     <h4>Varargs - Method with Variable Number of Formal Arguments (JDK 1.5)</h4> 
     <p>Before JDK 1.5, a method has to be declared with a <em>fixed number of formal arguments</em>. C-like <code>printf()</code>, which take a <em>variable number of argument</em>, cannot not be implemented. Although you can use an array for passing a variable number of arguments, it is not neat and requires some programming efforts.</p> 
     <p>JDK 1.5 introduces variable arguments (or varargs) and a new syntax "<code><em>Type</em>...</code>". For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
public PrintWriter printf(String format, Object... args)
public PrintWriter printf(Local l, String format, Object... args)</pre> 
     <p>Varargs can be used only for the last argument. The three dots (<code>...</code>) indicate that the last argument may be passed as an array or as a sequence of comma-separated arguments. The compiler automatically packs the varargs into an array. You could then retrieve and process each of these arguments inside the method's body as an array. It is possible to pass varargs as an array, because Java maintains the length of the array in an associated variable <code>length</code>.</p>

     <h4>Method Overloading</h4>

     <p>This seemingly correct codes produces <code>false</code> for <code>-5</code>, because <code>-5%2</code> is <code>-1</code> instead of <code>1</code>. You may rewrite the condition:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
public static boolean isOdd(int number) {
   if (number % 2 == 0) {
      return false;
   } else {
      return true;
   }
}</pre> 
     <p>The above produces the correct answer, but is poor. For boolean method, you can simply return the resultant <code>boolean</code> value of the comparison, instead of using a conditional statement, as follow:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
public static boolean isEven(int number) {
   return (number % 2 == 0);
}
public static boolean isOdd(int number) {
   return !(number % 2 == 0);
}</pre> 
     <h4>Mathematical Methods</h4> 
     <p>JDK provides many common-used Mathematical methods in a class called <code>Math</code>. The signatures of some of these methods are:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
double Math.pow(double x, double y) <span class="color-comment">// returns x raises to power of y</span>
double Math.sqrt(double x)          <span class="color-comment">// returns the square root of x</span>
double Math.random()                <span class="color-comment">// returns a random number in [0.0, 1.0)</span>
double Math.sin()
double Math.cos()</pre> 
     <p>The <code>Math</code> class also provide two constants:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
Math.PI   <span class="color-comment">// 3.141592653589793</span>
Math.E    <span class="color-comment">// 2.718281828459045</span></pre> 
     <p>To check all the available methods, open JDK API documentation ? select <em>package</em> "<code>java.lang</code>" ? select <em>class</em> "<code>Math</code>" ? choose <em>method</em>.</p> 
     <p>For examples,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int secretNumber = (int)Math.random()*100;  <span class="color-comment">// Generate a random int between 0 and 99</span>
&nbsp;
double radius = 5.5;
double area = radius*radius*Math.PI;
area = Math.pow(radius, 2)*Math.PI;         <span class="color-comment">// Not as efficient as above</span>
&nbsp;
int x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 2, y2 = 2;
double distance = Math.sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1));
int dx = x2 - x1;
int dy = y2 - y1;

     <h4>Implicit Type-Casting for Method's Parameters</h4> 
     <p>A method that takes a <code>double</code> parameter can accept any numeric primitive type, such as <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>. This is because implicit type-casting is carried out. However, a method that take a <code>int</code> parameter cannot accept a <code>double</code> value. This is because the implicit type-casting is always a widening conversion which prevents loss of precision. An explicit type-cast is required for narrowing conversion. Read "<a href="#typecasting">Type-Casting</a>" on the conversion rules.</p>

     <h3>Command-Line Arguments</h3> 
     <p>Java's <code>main(String[] args)</code> method takes an argument: <code>String[] args</code>, i.e., a <code>String</code> array named <code>args</code>. This is known as "command-line arguments", which corresponds to the augments provided by the user when the java program is invoked. For example, a Java program called <code>Arithmetic</code> could be invoked with additional command-line arguments as follows (in a "cmd" shell):</p> 
     <pre class="color-command">
java Arithmetic <strong>12 3456 +</strong></pre> 
     <p>Each argument, i.e., <code>"12"</code>, <code>"3456"</code> and <code>"+"</code>, is a <code>String</code>. Java runtime packs all the arguments into a <code>String</code> array and passes into the <code>main()</code> method as <code>args</code>. For this example, <code>args</code> has the following properties:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
args = {"12", "3456", "+"}   <span class="color-comment">// "args" is a String array</span>
args.length = 3              <span class="color-comment">// length of the array args</span>
args[0] = "12"   <span class="color-comment">            // Each element of the array is a String</span>
args[1] = "3456"
args[2] = "+"
args[0].length() = 2   <span class="color-comment">      // length of the String</span>
args[1].length() = 4
args[2].length() = 1</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">Example:</span> The program <code>Arithmetic</code> reads three parameters form the command-line, two integers and an arithmetic operator (<code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, <code>'*'</code>, or <code>'/'</code>), and performs the arithmetic operation accordingly. For example,</p> 
     <pre class="output">

     <p>Take note that:</p> 
     <ol> 
      <li><code>'&amp;'</code>, <code>'|'</code> and <code>'^'</code> are applicable when both operands are integers (<code>int</code>, <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>long</code> and <code>char</code>) or <code>boolean</code>s. When both operands are integers, they perform bitwise operations. When both operands are <code>boolean</code>s, they perform logical AND, OR, XOR operations (i.e., same as logical <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>^</code>). They are not applicable to <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>. On the other hand, logical AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) and OR (<code>||</code>) are applicable to <code>boolean</code>s only. <pre class="color-example">

      <li>The bitwise XOR is represented as <code>'^'</code>, which is the same as logical XOR (<code>^</code>).</li> 
      <li>The operators' precedence is in this order: <code>'~'</code>, <code>'&amp;'</code>, <code>'^'</code>, <code>'|'</code>, <code>'&amp;&amp;'</code>, <code>'||'</code>. For example, <pre class="color-example">

     <h4>Bit-Shift Operations</h4> 
     <p>Bit-shift operators perform left or right shift on an operand by a specified number of bits. Right-shift can be either signed-extended (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) (padded with signed bit) or unsigned-extended (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) (padded with zeros). Left-shift is always padded with zeros (for both signed and unsigned).</p>

     </table> 
     <p>Since all the Java's integers (byte, short, int and long) are signed integers, left-shift &lt;&lt; and right-shift &gt;&gt; operators perform signed-extended bit shift. Signed-extended right shift &gt;&gt; pads the most significant bits with the sign bit to maintain its sign (i.e., padded with zeros for positive numbers and ones for negative numbers). Operator &gt;&gt;&gt; (introduced in Java, not in C/C++) is needed to perform unsigned-extended right shift, which always pads the most significant bits with zeros. There is no difference between the signed-extended and unsigned-extended left shift, as both operations pad the least significant bits with zeros.</p>

     <h4>Types and Bitwise Operations</h4> 
     <p>The bitwise operators are applicable to integral primitive types: <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code> and <code>char</code>. <code>char</code> is treated as unsigned 16-bit integer. There are not applicable to <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>. The <code>'&amp;'</code>, <code>'|'</code>, <code>'^'</code>, when apply to two <code>boolean</code>s, perform logical operations. Bit-shift operators are not applicable to <code>boolean</code>s.</p> 
     <p>Like binary arithmetic operations:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><code>byte</code>, <code>short</code> and <code>char</code> operands are first promoted to <code>int</code>.</li> 
      <li>If both the operands are of the same type (<code>int</code> or <code>long</code>), they are evaluated in that type and returns a result of that type.</li> 
      <li>If the operands are of different types, the smaller operand (<code>int</code>) is promoted to the larger one (<code>long</code>). It then operates on the larger type (<code>long</code>) and returns a result in the larger type (<code>long</code>).</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h3>Algorithms</h3> 
     <p>Before writing a program to solve a problem, you have to first develop the steps involved, called <em>algorithm</em>, and then translate the <em>algorithm</em> into programming statements. This is the hardest part in programming, which is also hard to teach because the it involves intuition, knowledge and experience. </p> 
     <p>An <em>algorithm</em> is a step-by-step instruction to accomplice a task, which may involve decision and iteration. It is often expressed in English-like <em>pseudocode</em>, before translating into programming statement of a particular programming language. There is no standard on how to write pseudocode - simply write something that you, as well as other people, can understand the steps involved, and able to translate into a working program.</p> 
     <h4>Algorithm for Prime Testing</h4> 
     <p>Ancient Greek mathematicians like Euclid and Eratosthenes (around 300-200 BC) had developed many <em>algorithms</em> (or step-by-step instructions) to work on prime numbers. By definition, a <em>prime </em>is a positive integer that is divisible by one and itself only.</p> 
     <p>To test whether a number <em><code>x</code></em> is a prime number, we could apply the definition by dividing <em><code>x</code></em> by 2, 3, 4, ..., up to <code><em>x</em>-1</code>. If no divisor is found, then <em><code>x</code></em> is a prime number. Since divisors come in pair, there is no need to try all the factors until <em>x</em>-1, but up to <code>?<em>x</em></code>.</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
<span class="color-comment">// To test whether an int x is a prime</span>
int maxFactor = (int)Math.sqrt(x);   <span class="color-comment">// find the nearest integral square root of x</span>
assume x is a prime;
for (int factor = 2; factor &lt;= maxFactor; ++factor) {
   if (x is divisible by factor) {
      x is not a prime;
      break;  <span class="color-comment">  // a factor found, no need to find more factors</span>
   }
}</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">TRY</span>: translate the above pseudocode into a Java program called <code>PrimeTest</code>.</p> 
     <h4>Algorithm for Perfect Numbers</h4> 
     <p>A positive integer is called a <em>perfect number</em> if the sum of all its proper divisor is equal to its value. For example, the number <code>6</code> is perfect because its proper divisors are <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and <code>6=1+2+3</code>; but the number <code>10</code> is not perfect because its proper divisors are <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>5</code>, and <code>10?1+2+5</code>. Other perfect numbers are <code>28</code>, <code>496</code>, ...</p> 
     <p>The following algorithm can be used to test for perfect number:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
<span class="color-comment">// To test whether int x is a perfect number</span>
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i &lt; x; ++i) {
   if (x is divisible by i) {
      i is a proper divisor;
      add i into the sum;
   }
}
if (sum == x)
   x is a perfect number
else
   x is not a perfect number</pre> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">TRY</span>: translate the above pseudocode into a Java program called <code>PerfectNumberTest</code>.</p> 
     <h4>Algorithm on Computing Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</h4> 
     <p>Another early algorithm developed by ancient Greek mathematician Euclid (300 BC) is to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) (or Highest Common Factor (HCF)) of two integers. By definition, <code>GCD(a,b)</code> is the largest factor that divides both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p> 
     <p>Assume that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are positive integers and <code>a &gt;= b</code>, the Euclidean algorithm is based on these two properties:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
1.  GCD(a, 0) = a
2.  GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b), where "a mod b" denotes the remainder of a divides by b.
</pre> 
     <p>For example,</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
GCD(15, 5) = GCD(5, 0) = 5
GCD(99,88) = GCD(88,11) = GCD(11,0) = 11
GCD(3456,1233) = GCD(1233,990) = GCD(990,243) = GCD(243,18) = GCD(18,9) = GCD(9,0) = 9</pre> 
     <p>The Euclidean algorithm is as follows:</p> 
     <pre class="color-syntax">
GCD(a, b)  <span class="color-comment">// assume that a &gt;= b</span>
while (b != 0) {
<span class="color-comment">   // Change the value of a and b: a ? b, b ? a mod b, and repeat until b is 0</span>
   temp ? b
   b ? a mod b
   a ? temp
}
<span class="color-comment">// after the loop completes, i.e., b is 0, we have GCD(a, 0)</span>
GCD is a</pre> 
     <p>Before explaining the algorithm, suppose we want to exchange (or swap) the values of two variables <em><code>x</code></em> and <em><code>y</code></em>. Explain why the following code does not work.</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int x = 55, y=66;
<span class="color-comment">// swap the values of x and y</span>
x = y;
y = x;</pre> 
     <p>To swap the values of two variables, we need to define a temporary variable as follows:</p> 
     <pre class="color-example">
int x = 55, y=66;
int temp;
<span class="color-comment">// swap the values of x and y</span>
temp = y;
y = x;
x = temp;</pre> 
     <p>Let us look into the Euclidean algorithm, <code>GCD(a, b) = a</code>, if <code>b</code> is <code>0</code>. Otherwise, we replace <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>; <code>b</code> by <code>(a mod b)</code>, and compute <code>GCD(b, a mod b)</code>. Repeat the process until the second term is <code>0</code>. Try this out on pencil-and-paper to convince yourself that it works.</p> 
     <p><span class="line-heading">TRY</span>: Write a program called <code>GCD</code>, based on the above algorithm.</p>
