  <h1>Nonlinear Optimization Java Package</h1> 
  <p> New as of 5/10/10 --- Dr.-Ing. Andreas Maier reports that he has created a version of the fmin and Uncmin codes that permits "the parallel evaluation of functions, gradients, and Hessians (for computationally expensive functions)." The package can be obtained at <a href="http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/research/software/java-parallel-optimization-package/"> www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/research/software/java-parallel-optimization-package/</a> </p>
  <p> Currently (as of 8/8/05) this package contains Java translations of the 1-dimensional minimization routine, fmin, the multi-dimensional minimization routine Uncmin, the MINPACK nonlinear least squares routines (lmder1, lmder, lmdif1, and lmdif), and the SLATEC 1-dimensional zero-finding routine, dfzero. Eventually, the package will also contain Java translations of some of the MINPACK nonlinear equation solvers. </p>
  <p> The 1-dimensional minimization routine is an <b>unofficial</b> Java translation of the FORTRAN version of the public domain fmin routine that can be found at <a href="http://www.netlib.org/go/fmin.f">www.netlib.org/go/fmin.f</a>. </p>
  <p> The multi-dimensional minimization routine is an <b>unofficial</b> Java translation of the public domain FORTRAN Uncmin package (<a href="umdpn.f">umdpn.f</a>). For documentation see Dennis and Schnabel, <i>Numerical Methods for Unconstrained Optimization and Nonlinear Equations</i>, Prentice-Hall, 1983, and Schnabel, Koontz, and Weiss, "A Modular System of Algorithms for Unconstrained Minimization," <i>ACM Transactions of Mathematical Software</i>, 1985, pages 419 -- 440. </p>
  <p> Uncmin can perform <i>unconstrained</i> nonlinear optimizations. Here is information about <a href="constrained.html">constrained</a> nonlinear optimizations. </p>
  <p> The nonlinear least squares routines are <b>unofficial</b> Java translations of the FORTRAN versions of the public domain MINPACK nonlinear least squares routines that can be found at <a href="http://www.netlib.org/minpack">www.netlib.org/minpack</a>. </p>
  <p> The 1-dimensional zero-finding routine is an <b>unofficial</b> Java translation of the FORTRAN version of the public domain SLATEC dfzero routine that can be found at netlib. Either go to <a href="http://www.netlib.org">www.netlib.org</a> and do a search for dfzero.f, or go to <a href="http://www.netlib.org/slatec">www.netlib.org/slatec</a> and download the entire SLATEC library. </p>
  <h1>Warning!!!</h1> 
  <ul> 
   <li> These routines were translated by a user of numerical analysis routines rather than a developer. When Java optimization routines written by professional numerical analysts become available, they should be used. </li>
   <li> I have tried to be careful with the coding and have done some simple testing (see the FminTest, UncminTest_f77, LmderTest_f77, LmdifTest_f77, and FzeroTest applications). However, it is quite possible that I have introduced errors into the routines in the course of the translations. If you detect bugs in fmin, Uncmin, MINPACK, or fzero, PLEASE contact me (Steve Verrill at <a href="mailto:steve@swst.org"><kbd>sverrill@fs.fed.us</kbd></a> or 608-231-9375).<p> Note that <a href="minpack.prob.html">for "pathological" problems, results can depend upon programming details or the version of the Java Developer's Kit.</a></p><p> </p></li>
   <li> Uncmin_f77.java, UncminTest_f77.java, Minpack_f77.java, LmderTest_f77.java, and LmdifTest_f77.java make use of FORTRAN style indexing. In these you will tend to see <pre>
   for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
</pre> rather than <pre>
   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
</pre> To use the "_f77" routines you will have to declare your vectors and matrices to be one element larger (e.g., v[101] rather than v[100], and a[101][101] rather than a[100][100]), and you will have to fill elements 1 through n rather than elements 0 through n - 1. See UncminTest_f77.java. <p> Eventually, classes that make use of Java/C style indexing might become available (actually, this is unlikely). </p><h1>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h1> THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

    </ol> <br> <p> <i>Given the manner in which the routines are currently written,</i> you will need to import them (see the beginning of UncminTest_f77.java). All of the classes will have to be placed in subdirectories of a directory in your CLASSPATH. For the optimization classes, this subdirectory will have to be called optimization. For the Blas_f77 class, this subdirectory will have to be called linear_algebra. Console.class will have to be placed in a subdirectory called corejava. </p><p> Note that if you install the software in this manner, then to run, for example, FminTest you will have to issue the command:<br> </p><pre>
java optimization.FminTest
</pre> <i>Alternatively,</i> you could remove the package and import statements (other than import java.lang.*) in the source code, and compile all of the necessary files in the same directory. <p> To run Fmin you will need to write a driver class such as FminTest that implements the Fmin_methods interface. This class will have to include an f_to_minimize method. </p><p> To run Uncmin_f77 you will need to write a driver class such as UncminTest_f77 that implements the Uncmin_methods interface. This class will have to include an f_to_minimize method and, at the least, dummy gradient and hessian methods. </p><p> To run Minpack_f77 you will need to write a driver class such as LmderTest_f77 or LmdifTest_f77 that implements the Lmder_fcn or Lmdif_fcn interface. This class will have to include an fcn method. </p><p> To run Fzero you will need to write a driver class such as FzeroTest that implements the Fzero_methods interface. This class will have to include an f_to_zero method. </p><h1>Console.java</h1> Console.java is software described in Cornell and Horstmann's <i>Core Java</i> (SunSoft Press/Prentice-Hall). (I like this book.) It may be used for non-commerical purposes. I only make use of it in the testing routines. <h1>Support</h1> If you have questions about this software, or suggestions for improvement, please contact Steve Verrill at <a href="mailto:steve@swst.org"><kbd>sverrill@fs.fed.us</kbd></a> or 608-231-9375.
