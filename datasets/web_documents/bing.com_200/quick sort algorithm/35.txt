                   </table> <p> As one of the more advanced sorting algorithms, you might think that the Quicksort Algorithm is steeped in complicated theoretical background, but this is not so. Like Insertion Sort, this algorithm has a fairly simple concept at the core, but is made complicated by the constraints of the array structure.</p> <p> The basic concept is to pick one of the elements in the array as a pivot value around which the other elements will be rearranged. Everything less than the pivot is moved left of the pivot (into the left partition). Similarly, everything greater than the pivot goes into the right partition. At this point each partition is recursively quicksorted.</p> <p> The Quicksort algorithm is fastest when the median of the array is chosen as the pivot value. That is because the resulting partitions are of very similar size. Each partition splits itself in two and thus the base case is reached very quickly.</p> <p> In practice, the Quicksort algorithm becomes very slow when the array passed to it is already close to being sorted. Because there is no efficient way for the computer to find the median element to use as the pivot, the first element of the array is used as the pivot. So when the array is almost sorted, Quicksort doesn't partition it equally. Instead, the partitions are lopsided like in Figure 2. This means that one of the recursion branches is much deeper than the other, and causes execution time to go up. Thus, it is said that the more random the arrangement of the array, the faster the Quicksort Algorithm finishes.</p> <br> <img src="../image?id=32" alt="" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"> <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 1:</span> The ideal Quicksort on a random array.</p> <br> <img src="../image?id=33" alt="" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"> <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 2:</span> Quicksort on an already sorted array.</p><br> <p> These are the steps taken to sort an array using QuickSort:</p> <pre class="code">

Calling quickSort on elements 0 to 8	
<span class="green">Definitions: a "small" element is one whose value is less than
or equal to the value of the pivot. Likewise, a "large" element
is one whose value is larger than that of the pivot.
 At the beginning, the entire array is passed into the quicksort 
function and is essentially treated as one large partition.
 At this time, two indices are initialized: the left-to-right
search index, <i>i</i>, and the right-to-left search index, <i>k</i>. The value
of <i>i</i> is the index of the first element in the partition, in this 
case 0, and the value of <i>k</i> is 8, the index of the last element in
the partition. The relevance of these variables will be made apparent 
in the code below.					</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 4 5 9 2 6 8 7
<span class="green"> The first element in the partition, 3, is chosen as the pivot
element, around which two subpartitions will be created. The end
goal is to have all the small elements at the front of the partition,
in no particular order, followed by the pivot, followed by the large
elements.
 To do this, quicksort will scan rightwards for the first large 
element. Once this is found, it will look for the first small
element from the right. These two will then be swapped.
 Since <i>i</i> is currently set to zero, the pivot is actually compared
to itself in the search of the first large element.</span>
<span class="blue">3 </span><span class="blue">1 </span>4 5 9 2 6 8 7
<span class="green"> The search for the first large element continues rightwards. The 
value of <i>i</i> gets incremented as the search moves to the right.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 <span class="blue">4 </span>5 9 2 6 8 7
<span class="green"> Since 4 is greater than the pivot, the rightwards search
stops here. Thus the value of <i>i</i> remains 2.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 4 5 9 2 6 8 <span class="blue">7 </span>
<span class="green"> Now, starting from the right end of the array, quicksort searches
for the first small element. And so <i>k</i> is decremented with each
step leftwards through the partition.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 4 5 9 2 6 <span class="blue">8 </span>7
<span class="blue">3 </span>1 4 5 9 2 <span class="blue">6 </span>8 7
<span class="blue">3 </span>1 4 5 9 <span class="blue">2 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green"> Since 2 is not greater than the pivot, the leftwards search can stop.</span> 

3 1 <span class="red">2 </span>5 9 <span class="red">4 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green"> Now elements 4 and 2 (at positions 2 and 5, respectively) are swapped.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 <span class="blue">2 </span>5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> Next, the rightwards search resumes where it left off: at position 2, which
is stored in the index <i>i</i>.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 2 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> Immediately a large element is found, and the rightwards search stops
with <i>i</i> being equal to 3.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 2 5 9 <span class="blue">4 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green"> Next the leftwards search, too, resumes where it left off: <i>k</i> was 5
so the element at position 5 is compared to the pivot before <i>k</i>
is decremented again in search of a small element.</span>

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 2 5 <span class="blue">9 </span>4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> This continues without any matches for some time...</span> 

<span class="blue">3 </span>1 2 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 4 6 8 7 	 
<span class="blue">3 </span>1 <span class="blue">2 </span>5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green">  The small element is finally found, but no swap is performed since
at this stage, <i>i</i> is equal to <i>k</i>. This means that all the small
elements are on one side of the partition and all the large elements are 
on the other.</span>

<span class="red">2 </span>1 <span class="red">3 </span>5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green">  Only one thing remains to be done: the pivot is swapped with the element
currently at <i>i</i>. This is acceptable within the algorithm because it
only matters that the small element be to the left of the pivot, but their
respective order doesn't matter. Now, elements 0 to (<i>i</i> - 1) form the
left partition (containing all small elements) and elements <i>k</i> + 1 onward
form the right partition (containing all large elements.</span>
Calling quickSort on elements 0 to 1
<span class="green"> The right partition is passed into the quicksort function.</span>

<span class="blue">2 </span>1 3 5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> 2 is chosen as the pivot. 
It is also compared to itself in the search for a small element within 
the partition.</span>

<span class="blue">2 </span><span class="blue">1 </span>3 5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> The first, and in this case only, small element is found.</span>

<span class="blue">2 </span><span class="blue">1 </span>3 5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> Since the partition has only two elements, the leftwards search
begins at the second element and finds 1.</span>

<span class="red">1 </span><span class="red">2 </span>3 5 9 4 6 8 7
<span class="green"> The only swap to be made is actually the final step where the pivot
is inserted between the two partitions. In this case, the left partition 
has only one element and the right partition has zero elements.</span>

Calling quickSort on elements 0 to 0
<span class="green"> Now that the left partition of the partition above is quicksorted:
there is nothing else to be done</span>

Calling quickSort on elements 2 to 1
<span class="green"> The right partition of the partition above is quicksorted.
In this case the starting index is greater than the ending index due to the
way these are generated: the right partition starts one past the pivot
of its parent partition and goes until the last element of the parent
partition. So if the parent partition is empty, the indices generated
will be out of bounds, and thus no quicksorting will take place.</span>

Calling quickSort on elements 3 to 8
<span class="green">The right partition of the entire array is now being quicksorted</span>
<span class="green">5 is chosen as the pivot.</span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 4 6 8 7
1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span><span class="blue">9 </span>4 6 8 7
<span class="green">The rightwards scan for a large element is initiated.
9 is immediately found.</span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 4 6 8 <span class="blue">7 </span>
<span class="green">Thus, the leftwards search for a small element begins...</span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 4 6 <span class="blue">8 </span>7
1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 4 <span class="blue">6 </span>8 7
1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>9 <span class="blue">4 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green">At last, 4 is found. Note <i>k</i> = 5.</span>

1 2 3 5 <span class="red">4 </span><span class="red">9 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green"> Thus the first large and small elements to be found are swapped.</span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span><span class="blue">4 </span>9 6 8 7
<span class="green">The rightwards search for a large element begins anew.</span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>4 <span class="blue">9 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green">Now that it has been found, the rightward search can stop.</span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span>4 <span class="blue">9 </span>6 8 7
<span class="green">Since <i>k</i> was stopped at 5, this is the index from which the
leftward search resumes. </span>

1 2 3 <span class="blue">5 </span><span class="blue">4 </span>9 6 8 7
1 2 3 <span class="red">4 </span><span class="red">5 </span>9 6 8 7
<span class="green"> The last step for this partition is moving the pivot into the right spot.
Thus the left partition consists only of the element at 3 and the right partition is
spans positions 5 to 8 inclusive. </span>

Calling quickSort on elements 3 to 3
<span class="green"> The left partition is quicksorted (although nothing is done. </span>

since the search indices <i>i</i> and <i>k</i> have crossed. </span>

1 2 3 4 5 <span class="red">7 </span>6 8 <span class="red">9 </span>
<span class="green"> The pivot is swapped with the element at the position <i>k</i>: this is
the last step in splitting this partition into left and right subpartitions.</span>
Calling quickSort on elements 5 to 7
<span class="green"> The left partition is passed into the quicksort function. </span>

1 2 3 4 5 <span class="blue">7 </span>6 8 9

1 2 3 4 5 <span class="blue">7 </span>6 <span class="blue">8 </span>9

1 2 3 4 5 <span class="red">6 </span><span class="red">7 </span>8 9
