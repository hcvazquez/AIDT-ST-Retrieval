       Web and Mobile Application Development (WMA) is an associate certificate program from 
      <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/cas/computingparttime/">BCIT Computing </a>and is built on top of the 
      <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/6958acert">Applied Software Development</a> (ASD) program.
      <br> 
      <br> As a web application programmer, you will learn to build on top of OOP languages in server-side web application development frameworks to produce dynamic web pages, web applications and web services.
      <br> 
      <br> Android and Mobile Applications in Java, ASP.NET MVC and Advanced PHP are the foundations of this program. You will also receive hands-on advanced web scripting in HTML3, CSS3, AngularJS, Node.js, and MEAN Stack Web Application Development as learning to integrate open source tools is an important aspect of WMA.
      <br> 
      <br> Elective options are available in Android and Mobile Applications, iOS Application Development, Java Web App Design, Quality Assurance and Software Testing, Mobile App Development with C# and MySQL for data driven websites.
      <br> 
      <br> Web and Mobile Application Development graduates will have an understanding of several web technologies and be able to develop, test, and deploy industry standard software applications which run on web sites and mobile devices.

     <h1>Costs &amp; Supplies</h1> 
     <div class="marquicontent">
       The WMA program is built on top of ASD or equivalent education. The cost of the prerequisite ASD course tuition and books is approximately $4,000.
      <br> 
      <br> The cost of WMA alone is an additional cost of $ 5,000 tuition and books, so the total cost to complete the WMA associate certificate is approximately $9,000.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <strong>Please Note:<br> <br> </strong> WMA folllows on from ASD and students must already be solid object oriented application developers in Java and C#, as well as understand HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,&nbsp; jQuery and Intro PHP.
      <br> 
      <br> Some students may be able to complete both ASD and WMA in sequence in around four years, depending on course load. Keep in mind these are part-time programs and designed to be delivered one course at a time and each course has specific prerequisites. 
      <br> 
      <br> It is not possible for most students to fast track these associate certificates due to prerequisites and scheduling; some courses are not offered every term.
      <br> 
      <br> Most students complete these part-time associate certificates with one to two courses per term. 
      <br> 
      <br> Attendance and participation are mandatory. COMP courses have significant homework each week; budget 10+ hours per week per course.&nbsp;

            <p>This hands-on course follows on from COMP 1850 Applied Web Development Level 1. Students who already understand HTML and CSS will explore web development in more depth with new topics and techniques. Participants will gain a deeper understanding of the latest technologies including HTML5 and CSS3 for developing web sites and applications. There is a focus on responsive design and mobile presentation through the use of Media Queries. Adding behavior to web sites using JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery is introduced. Labs and exercises focus on industry standard web development methodology. Students gain experience creating templates for content management systems and presentation. Additional topics will include: leveraging Server Side Includes (SSI) for re-usable code, source control for managing your code, and web-based fonts for professional typography. COMP 1950 is a required course for the BCIT Computing Advanced Web Technologies associate certificates in Applied Web Development, AWD and Web and Mobile Application Development, WMA, as well as an elective in the CST Diploma. COMP 1950 and COMP 2015 are also the perquisites for COMP 2052 Android and Mobile Application Development Tools. By the end of this course successful students will be able to build dynamic and semantically marked-up content providing Search Engine Optimized (SEO) pages. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> COMP 1850 or equivalent HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge.</p>

            <p>This hands-on course follows on from COMP 1850 and COMP 2015 and is aimed at students who already understand how to build web pages with HMTL, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Angular is a popular JavaScript-based, open-source front-end application framework designed to address the challenges of developing modularized single-page applications. Vue.js is a newer open-source framework based on JavaScript that was designed for building user interfaces. Vue.js functions like Angular to rapidly modularize application development. Participants first learn Angular development fundamentals and then practice building components, modules, and services for data-driven, client-side web applications. Exercises also include: routing, asynchronous JSON transfer, and validation. These features are then implemented using Vue.js. Automated testing and redux architecture are also introduced using Angular. As well, there is a brief introduction to using Angular with the Apache Cordova framework for platform independent mobile development for Android and iOS. Students may also want to complete COMP 2912 Node.js Fundamentals, COMP 2913 React and Modern JavaScript plus COMP 3913 MEAN Stack Web Application Development. Upon successful completion students will have experience using these rich JavaScript frameworks to develop data-driven and interactive single-page web applications for all mainstream browsers. <strong>Prerequisite:</strong> COMP 1850 and COMP 2015, or equivalent knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery</p>

            <p>This hands-on course replaces COMP 2870. ASP.NET MVC (Model View Controller) allows students to build scalable and secure web applications to industry standards. Following on from COMP 2015 and COMP 2614, web developers who already understand HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery build on their experience with C# in the .NET Framework. Participants use patterns to script dynamic MVC websites in an alternate approach to ASP.NET Forms. Students learn to use both C# and Razor with the ASP.NET MVC framework to develop powerful data driven web applications with HTML5, jQuery and AJAX for full control over mark-up. Homework, exercises and labs focus on best practices in ASP.NET MVC. By the end of this course successful participants will be able to design, create and deploy sophisticated web applications with the latest ASP MVC tools. COMP 3973 is an elective in both “Advanced .NET Development”; “Web and Mobile Application Development” associate certificates plus the CST/PTS Diploma. <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> COMP 1850 and COMP 2015 and COMP 2614</p>
