    <p> This is a list of projects which have curated tasks specifically for new contributors. These are a great way to get started with a project, or to help share the load of working on open source projects. </p> 
    <p> Find a project you'd like to get involved with: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li>read the contributor guidelines for the project</li> 
     <li>get the project running locally</li> 
     <li>leave a message on a task you'd like to work on</li> 
     <li>get to work!</li>

    <p> We're looking for projects who can take the time out to help mentor developers as they get started with open source. </p> 
    <p> What sort of tasks are a good fit? </p>
    <ul> 
     <li>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights' worth of work</li> 
     <li>Tasks should stand alone - avoid core functionality on which other tasks depend</li> 
     <li>Tasks should be well described with pointers to help the implementer</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p></p> 
    <p> We suggest the tag <code>up-for-grabs</code> but using a different name is also acceptable. </p> 
    <p> If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple: </p>
    <ol> 
     <li>Tag bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li> 
     <li>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
