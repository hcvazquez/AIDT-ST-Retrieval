     <h3 id="bluefish_2_2_0">News - November 25 - Bluefish 2.2.0 released</h3> 
     <p>Bluefish 2.2.0 is a new major release and the start for the 2.2 series. Under the hood Bluefish 2.2.0 has a massive number of changes: Bluefish now works with gtk-3 (gtk-2 is still supported), and the syntax scanner had a major overhaul to make it faster, which is especially noticeable when working on large files.</p> 
     <p>Another big change in Bluefish 2.2.0 is the new search and replace function. It has been completely redesigned: the simple search function is now integrated in the main window, and the new function supports both search and replace in files on disk (next to already opened documents). Other new features include a toggle comment function that is context-aware (add &lt;!-- --&gt; comments in html code, use // comments in javascript code, etc.) and a select block feature that automatically selects the current context block and can be used multiple times to select the parent blocks. Another new feature of the syntax recognition is the autocompletion of user-defined functions, and a jump function that will bring you immediately the the definition of a function.</p> 
     <p>Next to all the new features many existing features have been improved and polished. Support for new languages has been added, such as Google Go, Vala and Ada. See the <a href="screenshots.html">introduction to Bluefish 2.2.0 movie</a> for a good overview.</p>
