      <h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1> 
      <p> In <a href="mandatoryblocking-timeline.html">recent years in Australia, various groups and individuals have campaigned</a> for government mandated ISP-based filtering and blocking of Web pages unsuitable for children. In 1999 it was politicians within the Federal Coalition Government, in early 2003 it was The Australia Institute, in late 2004 it was the Family First Party, in late 2005 it was people associated with the "Sexual Integrity Forum" organised by the Fatherhood Foundation including Senator Guy Barnett (Lib. Tas.). In early 2006 the <a href="mandatoryblocking.html">Federal Labor Party (ALP) announced</a> that they would implement mandatory ISP-filtering if elected. </p>
      <p> While recent advocates of mandatory ISP blocking have proposed that adults could identify themselves as wanting to access blocked material and ask to opt-out of blocking, this would interfere with adults' right to privacy. EFA shares the view recently expressed by world-renowned child online safety expert, <a href="https://www.wiredsafety.org/resources/biographies/parry/index.html">Parry Aftab</a> (regarding the to-date unenforceable USA <i>Child Online Protection Act 1998</i> which would force adults to identify themselves to obtain legal material): </p>
      <blockquote>
       "
       <i>'It annoys me a great deal that parents are not using software and now someone is trying to impinge on the privacy of adults, when the easy solution is using a filtering software. They work, and they have been working for the last five or six years,' Aftab said.</i>"

      </blockquote> 
      <p> PC-based (end user) filters are readily available and most have <a href="mandatoryblocking.html#23_17">features</a> that can assist parents to protect children from a range of Internet dangers as well as blocking unsuitable Web pages. EFA does not endorse the use of filtering software because it may result in a false sense of security and/or unduly restrict young people's internet access due to over-blocking etc. Nevertheless, EFA considers that parents who wish to have technological assistance in protecting their children should install filtering software and configure it to suit their family's needs, rather than demand the government mandate a one-size-fits-all ISP filtering system. </p>

      <hr> 
      <h1><a name="austlaw"></a>Australian Law related to use of Filtering Software</h1> 
      <p> The use of filtering software in Australia is not mandatory, and ISPs are not required to make server-based filtering available. </p>
      <p> However, since <a href="cens1.html">Internet censorship legislation</a> became operative on 1 January 2000, ISPs have been required to make one or more "scheduled" filtering products available to their customers, either via a direct link to download a filter, or to a download page on the Internet Industry Association ("IIA") site offering the full range of scheduled filters, or by providing a CD containing a filter for installation. Alternatively, or in addition, ISPs may choose to offer optional server-based filtering. </p>
      <p> ISPs are not permitted to charge more than the cost price of obtaining, supplying and supporting filters (this is a requirement of the Industry Code referred to below). </p>
      <p> The "scheduled" filters are filters listed in the <a href="http://www.iia.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=3&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=33">Industry Content Code of Practice</a> developed by the IIA and registered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ("ACMA"), a government regulatory agency. The Code applies to all Australian ISPs and the ACMA has powers to enforce compliance. Further information is available on the <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.65640:STANDARD:445498500:pc=PC_90080">ACMA's page about the Internet Content Codes</a> and the <a href="http://www.iia.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=416&amp;Itemid=9">IIA's Guide for Users</a>. </p>
      <p> The scheduled filters are also known as "IIA Family Friendly Filters". As stated in the <a href="http://www.iia.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=416&amp;Itemid=9">IIA Guide for Users</a>: </p>
      <blockquote>
       "
       <i>To qualify for IIA Family Friendly Filter status, a filter must undergo rigorous independent testing to ensure that it meets the criteria as set out in the IIA Codes. These include effectiveness, ease of use, configurability, availability of support and agreement by the filter company providing the filter to update the filter as required by ACMA, for example where ACMA determines following a complaint, that a specified site is prohibited under Australian law</i>."
      </blockquote> 
      <p> While not a requirement of legislation, the IIA also operates the "IIA Family Friendly ISP Program". As stated in the <a href="http://www.iia.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=121&amp;Itemid=33">IIA Guide for ISPs</a>: </p>
      <blockquote>
       "
       <i>ISPs who are compliant with the IIA Codes are eligible to apply for IIA 'Family Friendly ISP' status. This does not require joining the IIA, although IIA member ISPs are able to participate in the program at no cost. Family Friendly ISPs are authorised to display the Ladybird Logo which signifies adherence to best practice standards.</i>"

      <h3><a name="ifff"></a>"IIA Family Friendly Filters"</h3> 
      <p> As noted above, these are filters that have qualified as scheduled/"IIA Family Friendly Filters" (according to <a href="http://www.iia.net.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=416&amp;Itemid=9">IIA's site</a> as at 30 April 2006) because the makers have submitted their filter for testing of "effectiveness, ease of use, configurability, availability of support" and agreed to block access to URLs notified to them by the ACMA. Products on the list have been on it since at least 2002 and since then no other or new filters have been added (as at 30 April 2006). The most recent test results were published by the ACMA in March 2002 in a report titled <a href="http://www.acma.gov.au/acmainterwr/aba/newspubs/documents/filtereffectiveness.pdf"><i>Effectiveness of Internet Filtering Software Products</i> [PDF 1591 Kb]</a>.

The engine that powers K9 is designed for commercial customers, who, quite naturally, don't want their employees to become non-productive because of a mistake in their filtering solution. So we've taken great care to not over-block. For example, K9 will allow you to access breast cancer sites, while blocking nudity or pornography. K9 will allow access to drug treatment and information sites, while blocking access to sites that promote or glamorize illegal drug use. The engine that K9 uses to decide which Web sites are inappropriate for children is more sophisticated than many other programs</i>". (It should be noted that many filter makers have made similar claims over the years and the filters subsequently found to over-block significantly.) </p>

       <li><a href="http://www.webshield.net.au">Webshield ISP</a> (displays IIA Family Friendly ISP ladybird)<br> Nationwide dialup access (via 0198) and broadband access, with server-based content filtering. From the list of blocking categories on Webshield's site (in April 2006), it is likely the blocking software used is 8e6 (previously named X-Stop) as the descriptions of blocking categories are the same. According to a <a href="http://www.biblexplore.org/webshield.htm">page on the Lismore Christadelphians' 'Explore the Bible' web site</a> (April 2006): "<i>Webshield is an initiative undertaken by Christadelphians to help parents and concerned individuals take control of Internet Content</i>". </li>
      </ul> 
      <p> Note: Filtered ISP services may not be suitable for families wanting different levels of access restriction based on age, etc, of family members. While some of the above services appear to provide customisable levels/categories of filtering, the customisation apparently applies on an Internet access account basis, i.e. to the whole family using the account, rather than being customisable for each family member using the account. Also, they may not be suitable where one or more members wish to use P2P technology. In the latter regard, for example, Webshield <a href="http://www.webshield.net.au/htm2/a_services.htm">state on their web site</a> that access to all content available using peer to peer (P2P) technologies is blocked because "[i]t is impossible to filter the information exchanged" via P2P. It is possible that all or many filtered ISPs also block access to P2P networks without making that clear on their web site. Many PC-based (end-user) filters provide an option to block, or not block, access to P2P and some enable this option to be set differently for each user of the PC (e.g. each member of a family). </p>

      <h2><a name="underover"></a>Reports on tests focussed on under- and over- blocking issues</h2> 
      <p> Criticisms have been been made about the nature of the material that is blocked by particular packages. The list of sites blocked by each package is generally a closely-guarded secret and as such, parents have no option but to trust the judgement and stated policies of the commercial entities responsible. (Net Nanny is one of the few filters, possibly the only one, that allows authorised users to review the list of permitted and restricted sites.) </p>
      <p> CYBERsitter in particular came under a storm of criticism in 1996/97 for its action in blocking <a href="http://www.peacefire.org/censorware/CYBERsitter.html"> Peacefire, </a> a teenage anti-censorship group, threatening legal action against critics and journalists, blocking entire domains, as well as blocking feminist and other sites which many parents would not consider objectionable. This is the danger of corporatised censorship. </p>
      <p> Under- and over- blocking can result from a variety of factors including: </p>
      <ul> 
       <li>Many filter makers build their blocking databases by using software that crawls the Web looking for pages that contain particular keywords, etc, and then use automated artificial intelligence to categorise 'suspect' pages. While some filter makers claim that a human reviews the automated categorisation, it would be physically impossible for humans, even a large group of humans, to review every page. </li>
       <li>Some filter makers' products do not include a URL blocking database. Instead, the software uses artificial intelligence to automatically analyse every page in real time and either permit or deny access. </li>
       <li>Some filter makers may intentionally block information that is not in accord with their own views, morals, and/or religious beliefs (e.g. information about safe sex, contraception, abortion, feminism, homosexuality, etc). This is particularly likely in products targeted at the fundamentalist Christian market. Whether or not this is a problem for end-users with different views depends on whether such content is included in blocking categories that the end-user can switch off, or whether it is lumped into a category such as "pornography", "sex", etc, which cannot be switched off without also permitting access to sexually explicit material. (For information about filter software companies known to have connections with religious groups, see <a href="#connections">Filter Software Companies' connections with religious groups and/or governments</a>.) </li>

        <i>Iran has recently acknowledged, as our testing confirms, that it uses the commercial filtering package SmartFilter - made by the US-based company, Secure Computing - as the primary technical engine of its filtering system. This commercial software product is configured as part of the Iranian filtering system to block both internationally-hosted sites in English and sites in local languages. SmartFilter, as with all commercial filtering software packages, is prone to over-blocking, errors, and a near-total lack of transparency. In effect, Iran outsources many of the decisions for what its citizens can access on the Internet to a United States company, which in turn profits from its complicity in such a regime.</i>".
